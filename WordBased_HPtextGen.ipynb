commamark privet drive commamark were proud to say that they were perfectly normal commamark thank you very much periodmark they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious commamark because they just didn't hold with such nonsense periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings commamark which made drills periodmark he was a big commamark beefy man with hardly any neck commamark although he did have a very large mustache periodmark mrs periodmark dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck commamark which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences commamark spying on the neighbors periodmark the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere periodmark nextline nextline the dursleys had everything they wanted commamark but they also had a secret commamark and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it periodmark they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters periodmark mrs periodmark Potter was mrs periodmark dursley's sister commamark but they hadn't met for several years semicolonmark in fact commamark mrs periodmark dursley pretended she didn't have a sister commamark because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be periodmark the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street periodmark the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son commamark too commamark but they had never even seen him periodmark this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away semicolonmark they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that periodmark nextline nextline when mr periodmark and mrs periodmark dursley woke up on the dull commamark gray tuesday our story starts commamark there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country periodmark mr periodmark dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work commamark and mrs periodmark dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair periodmark nextline nextline none of them noticed a large commamark tawny owl flutter past the window periodmark nextline nextline at half past eight commamark mr periodmark dursley picked up his briefcase commamark pecked mrs periodmark dursley on the cheek commamark and tried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed commamark because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls periodmark little tyke commamark chortled mr periodmark dursley as he left the house periodmark he got into his car and backed out of number four's drive periodmark nextline nextline it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar 2dashes a cat reading a map periodmark for a second commamark mr periodmark dursley didn't realize what he had seen 2dashes then he jerked his head around to look again periodmark there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive commamark but there wasn't a map in sight periodmark what could he have been thinking of questionmark it must have been a trick of the light periodmark mr periodmark dursley blinked and stared at the cat periodmark it stared back periodmark as mr periodmark dursley drove around the corner and up the road commamark he watched the cat in his mirror periodmark it was now reading the sign that said privet drive 2dashes no commamark looking at the sign semicolonmark cats couldn't read maps or signs periodmark mr periodmark dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind periodmark as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day periodmark nextline nextline but on the edge of town commamark drills were driven out of his mind by something else periodmark as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam commamark he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about periodmark people in cloaks periodmark mr periodmark dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes 2dashes the getups you saw on young people exclamationmark he supposed this was some stupid new fashion periodmark he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by periodmark they were whispering excitedly together periodmark mr periodmark dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all semicolonmark why commamark that man had to be older than he was commamark and wearing an emerald-green cloak exclamationmark the nerve of him exclamationmark but then it struck mr periodmark dursley that this was probably some silly stunt 2dashes these people were obviously collecting for something periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark that would be it periodmark the traffic moved on and a few minutes later commamark mr periodmark dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot commamark his mind back on drills periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor periodmark if he hadn't commamark he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning periodmark he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight commamark though people down in the street did semicolonmark they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead periodmark most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime periodmark mr periodmark dursley commamark however commamark had a perfectly normal commamark owl-free morning periodmark he yelled at five different people periodmark he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more periodmark he was in a very good mood until lunchtime commamark when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery periodmark nextline nextline he'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's periodmark he eyed them angrily as he passed periodmark he didn't know why commamark but they made him uneasy periodmark this bunch were whispering excitedly commamark too commamark and he couldn't see a single collecting tin periodmark it was on his way back past them commamark clutching a large doughnut in a bag commamark that he caught a few words of what they were saying periodmark nextline nextline the potters commamark that's right commamark that's what i heard yes commamark their son commamark Harry nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley stopped dead periodmark fear flooded him periodmark he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them commamark but thought better of it periodmark nextline nextline he dashed back across the road commamark hurried up to his office commamark snapped at his secretary not to disturb him commamark seized his telephone commamark and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind periodmark he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache commamark thinking periodmark periodmark periodmark no commamark he was being stupid periodmark Potter wasn't such an unusual name periodmark he was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry periodmark come to think of it commamark he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry periodmark he'd never even seen the boy periodmark it might have been harvey periodmark or harold periodmark there was no point in worrying mrs periodmark dursley semicolonmark she always got so upset at any mention of her sister periodmark he didn't blame her 2dashes if he'd had a sister like that periodmark periodmark periodmark but all the same commamark those people in cloaks periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock commamark he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door periodmark nextline nextline sorry commamark he grunted commamark as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell periodmark it was a few seconds before mr periodmark dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak periodmark he didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground periodmark on the contrary commamark his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare commamark don't be sorry commamark my dear sir commamark for nothing could upset me today exclamationmark rejoice commamark for you-know-who has gone at last exclamationmark even muggles like yourself should be celebrating commamark this happy commamark happy day exclamationmark nextline nextline and the old man hugged mr periodmark dursley around the middle and walked off periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley stood rooted to the spot periodmark he had been hugged by a complete stranger periodmark he also thought he had been called a muggle commamark whatever that was periodmark he was rattled periodmark he hurried to his car and set off for home commamark hoping he was imagining things commamark which he had never hoped before commamark because he didn't approve of imagination periodmark nextline nextline as he pulled into the driveway of number four commamark the first thing he saw 2dashes and it didn't improve his mood 2dashes was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning periodmark it was now sitting on his garden wall periodmark he was sure it was the same one semicolonmark it had the same markings around its eyes periodmark nextline nextline shoo exclamationmark said mr periodmark dursley loudly periodmark the cat didn't move periodmark it just gave him a stern look periodmark was this normal cat behavior questionmark mr periodmark dursley wondered periodmark trying to pull himself together commamark he let himself into the house periodmark he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife periodmark nextline nextline mrs periodmark dursley had had a nice commamark normal day periodmark she told him over dinner all about mrs periodmark next door's problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word (won't exclamationmark) periodmark mr periodmark dursley tried to act normally periodmark when dudley had been put to bed commamark he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news colonmark and finally commamark bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today periodmark although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight commamark there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise periodmark experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern periodmark the newscaster allowed himself a grin periodmark nextline nextline most mysterious periodmark and now commamark over to jim mcguffin with the weather periodmark going to be any more showers of owls tonight commamark jim questionmark nextline nextline well commamark ted commamark said the weatherman commamark i don't know about that commamark but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today periodmark viewers as far apart as kent commamark yorkshire commamark and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday commamark they've had a downpour of shooting stars exclamationmark perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early 2dashes it's not until next week commamark folks exclamationmark but i can promise a wet night tonight periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley sat frozen in his armchair periodmark shooting stars all over britain questionmark owls flying by daylight questionmark mysterious people in cloaks all over the place questionmark and a whisper commamark a whisper about the potters periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline mrs periodmark dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea periodmark it was no good periodmark he'd have to say something to her periodmark he cleared his throat nervously periodmark er 2dashes petunia commamark dear 2dashes you haven't heard from your sister lately commamark have you questionmark nextline nextline as he had expected commamark mrs periodmark dursley looked shocked and angry periodmark after all commamark they normally pretended she didn't have a sister periodmark nextline nextline no commamark she said sharply periodmark why questionmark nextline nextline funny stuff on the news commamark mr periodmark dursley mumbled periodmark owls periodmark periodmark periodmark shooting stars periodmark periodmark periodmark and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline so questionmark snapped mrs periodmark dursley periodmark nextline nextline well commamark i just thought periodmark periodmark periodmark maybe periodmark periodmark periodmark it was something to do with periodmark periodmark periodmark you know periodmark periodmark periodmark her crowd periodmark nextline nextline mrs periodmark dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips periodmark mr periodmark dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name Potter periodmark he decided he didn't dare periodmark instead he said commamark as casually as he could commamark their son 2dashes he'd be about dudley's age now commamark wouldn't he questionmark nextline nextline i suppose so commamark said mrs periodmark dursley stiffly periodmark nextline nextline what's his name again questionmark howard commamark isn't it questionmark nextline nextline Harry periodmark nasty commamark common name commamark if you ask me periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark yes commamark said mr periodmark dursley commamark his heart sinking horribly periodmark yes commamark i quite agree periodmark nextline nextline he didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed periodmark nextline nextline while mrs periodmark dursley was in the bathroom commamark mr periodmark dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden periodmark the cat was still there periodmark nextline nextline it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something periodmark nextline nextline was he imagining things questionmark could all this have anything to do with the potters questionmark if it did periodmark periodmark periodmark if it got out that they were related to a pair of 2dashes well commamark he didn't think he could bear it periodmark nextline nextline the dursleys got into bed periodmark mrs periodmark dursley fell asleep quickly but mr periodmark dursley lay awake commamark turning it all over in his mind periodmark his last commamark comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved commamark there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs periodmark dursley periodmark the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark he couldn't see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on 2dashes he yawned and turned over 2dashes it couldn't affect them periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline how very wrong he was periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep commamark but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness periodmark it was sitting as still as a statue commamark its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive periodmark it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street commamark nor when two owls swooped overhead periodmark in fact commamark it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all periodmark nextline nextline a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching commamark appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground periodmark the cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed periodmark nextline nextline nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive periodmark he was tall commamark thin commamark and very old commamark judging by the silver of his hair and beard commamark which were both long enough to tuck into his belt periodmark he was wearing long robes commamark a purple cloak that swept the ground commamark and high-heeled commamark buckled boots periodmark nextline nextline his blue eyes were light commamark bright commamark and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked commamark as though it had been broken at least twice periodmark this man's name was albus dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline albus dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome periodmark he was busy rummaging in his cloak commamark looking for something periodmark but he did seem to realize he was being watched commamark because he looked up suddenly at the cat commamark which was still staring at him from the other end of the street periodmark for some reason commamark the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him periodmark he chuckled and muttered commamark i should have known periodmark nextline nextline he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket periodmark it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter periodmark he flicked it open commamark held it up in the air commamark and clicked it periodmark the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop periodmark he clicked it again 2dashes the next lamp flickered into darkness periodmark twelve times he clicked the put-outer commamark until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance commamark which were the eyes of the cat watching him periodmark if anyone looked out of their window now commamark even beady-eyed mrs periodmark dursley commamark they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement periodmark dumbledore slipped the put-outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four commamark where he sat down on the wall next to the cat periodmark he didn't look at it commamark but after a moment he spoke to it periodmark nextline nextline fancy seeing you here commamark Professor McGonagall periodmark nextline nextline he turned to smile at the tabby commamark but it had gone periodmark instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes periodmark she commamark too commamark was wearing a cloak commamark an emerald one periodmark her black hair was drawn into a tight bun periodmark she looked distinctly ruffled periodmark nextline nextline how did you know it was me questionmark she asked periodmark nextline nextline my dear Professor commamark i 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly periodmark nextline nextline you'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day commamark said Professor McGonagall periodmark nextline nextline all day questionmark when you could have been celebrating questionmark i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily periodmark nextline nextline oh yes commamark everyone's celebrating commamark all right commamark she said impatiently periodmark nextline nextline you'd think they'd be a bit more careful commamark but no 2dashes even the muggles have noticed something's going on periodmark it was on their news periodmark she jerked her head back at the dursleys' dark living-room window periodmark i heard it periodmark flocks of owls periodmark periodmark periodmark shooting stars periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark well commamark they're not completely stupid periodmark they were bound to notice something periodmark shooting stars down in kent 2dashes i'll bet that was dedalus diggle periodmark he never had much sense periodmark nextline nextline you can't blame them commamark said dumbledore gently periodmark we've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years periodmark nextline nextline i know that commamark said Professor McGonagall irritably periodmark but that's no reason to lose our heads periodmark people are being downright careless commamark out on the streets in broad daylight commamark not even dressed in muggle clothes commamark swapping rumors periodmark nextline nextline she threw a sharp commamark sideways glance at dumbledore here commamark as though hoping he was going to tell her something commamark but he didn't commamark so she went on periodmark a fine thing it would be if commamark on the very day youknow-who seems to have disappeared at last commamark the muggles found out about us all periodmark i suppose he really has gone commamark dumbledore questionmark nextline nextline it certainly seems so commamark said dumbledore periodmark we have much to be thankful for periodmark would you care for a lemon drop questionmark nextline nextline a what questionmark nextline nextline a lemon drop periodmark they're a kind of muggle sweet i'm rather fond of nextline nextline no commamark thank you commamark said Professor McGonagall coldly commamark as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops periodmark as i say commamark even if you-know-who has gone - nextline nextline my dear Professor commamark surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name questionmark all this 'you- know-who' nonsense 2dashes for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name colonmark Voldemort periodmark Professor McGonagall flinched commamark but dumbledore commamark who was unsticking two lemon drops commamark seemed not to notice periodmark it all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'you-know-who periodmark' i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort's name periodmark nextline nextline i know you haven 't commamark said Professor McGonagall commamark sounding half exasperated commamark half admiring periodmark but you're different periodmark everyone knows you're the only one you-know- oh commamark all right commamark Voldemort commamark was frightened of periodmark nextline nextline you flatter me commamark said dumbledore calmly periodmark Voldemort had powers i will never have periodmark nextline nextline only because you're too 2dashes well 2dashes noble to use them periodmark nextline nextline it's lucky it's dark periodmark i haven't blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said commamark the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around periodmark you know what everyone's saying questionmark about why he's disappeared questionmark about what finally stopped him questionmark nextline nextline it seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss commamark the real reason she had been waiting on a cold commamark hard wall all day commamark for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now periodmark it was plain that whatever everyone was saying commamark she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true periodmark dumbledore commamark however commamark was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer periodmark nextline nextline what they're saying commamark she pressed on commamark is that last night Voldemort turned up in godric's hollow periodmark he went to find the potters periodmark the rumor is that lily and James Potter are 2dashes are 2dashes that they're 2dashes dead periodmark “ nextline nextline dumbledore bowed his head periodmark Professor McGonagall gasped periodmark nextline nextline lily and James periodmark periodmark periodmark i can't believe it periodmark periodmark periodmark i didn't want to believe it periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark albus periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder periodmark i know periodmark periodmark periodmark i know periodmark periodmark periodmark he said heavily periodmark nextline nextline Professor mcgonagall's voice trembled as she went on periodmark that's not all periodmark nextline nextline they're saying he tried to kill the potter's son commamark Harry periodmark but 2dashes he couldn't periodmark he couldn't kill that little boy periodmark no one knows why commamark or how commamark but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter commamark voldemort's power somehow broke 2dashes and that's why he's gone periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore nodded glumly periodmark nextline nextline it's 2dashes it's true questionmark faltered Professor McGonagall periodmark after all he's done periodmark periodmark periodmark all the people he's killed periodmark periodmark periodmark he couldn't kill a little boy questionmark it's just astounding periodmark periodmark periodmark of all the things to stop him periodmark periodmark periodmark but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive questionmark nextline nextline we can only guess commamark said dumbledore periodmark we may never know periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles periodmark dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it periodmark it was a very odd watch periodmark nextline nextline it had twelve hands but no numbers semicolonmark instead commamark little planets were moving around the edge periodmark it must have made sense to dumbledore commamark though commamark because he put it back in his pocket and said commamark hagrid's late periodmark i suppose it was he who told you i'd be here commamark by the way questionmark nextline nextline yes commamark said Professor McGonagall periodmark and i don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here commamark of all places questionmark nextline nextline i've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle periodmark they're the only family he has left now periodmark nextline nextline you don't mean 2dashes you can't mean the people who live here questionmark cried Professor McGonagall commamark jumping to her feet and pointing at number four periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore 2dashes you can't periodmark i've been watching them all day periodmark you couldn't find two people who are less like us periodmark and they've got this son 2dashes i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street commamark screaming for sweets periodmark nextline nextline Harry Potter come and live here exclamationmark nextline nextline it's the best place for him commamark said dumbledore firmly periodmark his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older periodmark i've written them a letter periodmark nextline nextline a letter questionmark repeated Professor McGonagall faintly commamark sitting back down on the wall periodmark really commamark dumbledore commamark you think you can explain all this in a letter questionmark these people will never understand him exclamationmark he'll be famous 2dashes a legend 2dashes i wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future 2dashes there will be books written about Harry 2dashes every child in our world will know his name exclamationmark nextline nextline exactly commamark said dumbledore commamark looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses periodmark it would be enough to turn any boy's head periodmark famous before he can walk and talk exclamationmark famous for something he won't even remember exclamationmark cara you see how much better off he'll be commamark growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it questionmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall opened her mouth commamark changed her mind commamark swallowed commamark and then said commamark yes 2dashes yes commamark you're right commamark of course periodmark but how is the boy getting here commamark dumbledore questionmark she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it periodmark nextline nextline hagrid's bringing him periodmark nextline nextline you think it 2dashes wise 2dashes to trust Hagrid with something as important as this questionmark nextline nextline i would trust Hagrid with my life commamark said dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline i'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place commamark said Professor McGonagall grudgingly commamark but you can't pretend he's not careless periodmark he does tend to 2dashes what was that questionmark nextline nextline a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them periodmark it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight semicolonmark it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky 2dashes and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them periodmark nextline nextline if the motorcycle was huge commamark it was nothing to the man sitting astride it periodmark he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide periodmark he looked simply too big to be allowed commamark and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face commamark he had hands the size of trash can lids commamark and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins periodmark in his vast commamark muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid commamark said dumbledore commamark sounding relieved periodmark at last periodmark and where did you get that motorcycle questionmark nextline nextline borrowed it commamark Professor dumbledore commamark sit commamark said the giant commamark climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke periodmark young Sirius black lent it to me periodmark i've got him commamark sir periodmark nextline nextline no problems commamark were there questionmark nextline nextline no commamark sir 2dashes house was almost destroyed commamark but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin'

hagrid's shoulders shook commamark Professor McGonagall blinked furiously commamark and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out periodmark nextline nextline well commamark said dumbledore finally commamark that's that periodmark we've no business staying here periodmark we may as well go and join the celebrations periodmark nextline nextline yeah

McGonagall blew her nose in reply periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore turned and walked back down the street periodmark on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put-outer periodmark he clicked it once commamark and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the

commamark the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen periodmark Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up periodmark one small hand closed on the letter

exclamationmark nextline nextline chapter two nextline nextline the vanishing glass nextline nextline nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step commamark but privet drive had hardly changed at all periodmark the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys' front door semicolonmark it crept into their living room commamark which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr periodmark dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls periodmark only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed periodmark nextline nextline ten years ago commamark there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing

commamark playing a computer game with his father commamark being hugged and kissed by his mother periodmark nextline nextline the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house commamark too periodmark nextline nextline yet Harry Potter was still there commamark asleep at the moment commamark but not for long periodmark his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice

the stairs was full of them commamark and that was where he slept periodmark nextline nextline when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen periodmark the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley's birthday presents periodmark it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted commamark not to mention the second television and the racing bike periodmark exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry commamark as dudley was very fat and hated exercise 2dashes unless of course it involved punching somebody periodmark dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry commamark but he couldn't often catch him periodmark Harry didn't look it commamark but he was very fast periodmark nextline nextline perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard commamark but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age periodmark he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley's commamark and dudley was about four times bigger than he was periodmark Harry had a thin face commamark knobbly knees commamark black hair commamark and bright green eyes periodmark he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose periodmark the only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his

all over the place periodmark nextline nextline Harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother periodmark dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon periodmark he had a large pink face commamark not much neck commamark small commamark watery blue eyes commamark and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick commamark fat head periodmark aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel 2dashes Harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig periodmark nextline nextline Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table commamark which was

commamark he said commamark looking up at his mother and father periodmark that's two less than last year periodmark nextline nextline darling commamark you haven't counted auntie marge's present commamark see commamark it's here under this big one from mommy and daddy periodmark nextline nextline all right commamark thirty-seven then commamark said dudley commamark going red in the face periodmark nextline nextline Harry commamark who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on commamark began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over periodmark nextline nextline aunt petunia obviously scented danger commamark too commamark because she said quickly commamark and we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today periodmark how's that commamark popkin questionmark two more presents periodmark is that all right'' dudley thought for a moment periodmark it looked like hard work periodmark finally he said slowly commamark so i'll have thirty periodmark periodmark periodmark thirty periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline thirty-nine commamark sweetums commamark said aunt petunia periodmark nextline nextline oh periodmark dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel periodmark all right then periodmark nextline nextline uncle vernon chuckled periodmark little tyke wants his money's worth commamark just like

suggested periodmark nextline nextline don't be silly commamark vernon commamark she hates the boy periodmark nextline nextline the dursleys often spoke about Harry like this commamark as though he

your friend 2dashes yvonne questionmark nextline nextline on vacation in majorca commamark snapped aunt petunia periodmark nextline nextline you could just leave me here commamark Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley's computer) periodmark nextline nextline aunt petunia looked as though she'd just

but they weren't listening periodmark nextline nextline i suppose we could take him to the zoo commamark said aunt petunia slowly commamark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline and leave him in the car periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline that car's new commamark he's not sitting in it alone periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline dudley

until christmas periodmark nextline nextline i'm not going to do anything commamark said Harry commamark honestly periodmark periodmark nextline nextline but uncle vernon didn't believe him periodmark no one ever did periodmark nextline nextline the problem was commamark strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn't make them happen periodmark nextline nextline once commamark aunt petunia commamark tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all commamark had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs commamark which she left to hide that horrible scar periodmark dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry commamark who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day commamark where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses periodmark nextline nextline next morning commamark however commamark he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this commamark even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly periodmark nextline nextline another time commamark aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) 2dashes the harder she tried to pull it over his head commamark the smaller it seemed to become commamark until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet commamark but certainly wouldn't fit Harry periodmark aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and commamark to his great relief commamark Harry wasn't punished periodmark nextline nextline on the other hand commamark he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens periodmark dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when commamark as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's commamark there he was sitting on the chimney periodmark the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings periodmark but all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors periodmark Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump periodmark nextline nextline but today commamark nothing was going to go wrong periodmark it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school commamark his cupboard commamark or mrs periodmark figg's cabbage-smelling living room periodmark nextline nextline while he drove commamark uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia periodmark he liked to complain about things colonmark people at work commamark Harry commamark the council commamark Harry commamark the bank commamark and Harry were just a few of his favorite

commamark as a motorcycle overtook them periodmark nextline nextline i had a dream about a motorcycle commamark said Harry commamark remembering suddenly periodmark it was flying periodmark nextline nextline uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front periodmark he turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry commamark his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache colonmark motorcycles don't fly exclamationmark nextline nextline dudley and piers sniggered periodmark nextline nextline i know they don't commamark said Harry periodmark it was only a dream periodmark nextline nextline but he wished he hadn't said anything periodmark if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions commamark it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't commamark no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon 2dashes they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas periodmark nextline nextline it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families periodmark the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then commamark because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away commamark they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop periodmark it wasn't bad commamark either commamark Harry thought commamark licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley commamark except that it wasn't blond periodmark nextline nextline Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time periodmark he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers commamark who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime commamark wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him periodmark they ate in the zoo restaurant commamark and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top commamark uncle vernon bought him

nextline after lunch they went to the reptile house periodmark it was cool and dark in there commamark with lit windows all along the walls periodmark behind the glass commamark all sorts of lizards

quickly found the largest snake in the place periodmark it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can 2dashes but at the moment it didn't look in the

nextline nextline make it move commamark he whined at his father periodmark uncle vernon tapped on the glass commamark but the snake didn't budge periodmark nextline nextline do it again commamark dudley ordered periodmark uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles commamark but the snake just snoozed on periodmark nextline nextline this is boring commamark dudley moaned periodmark he shuffled away periodmark nextline nextline Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake periodmark he wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself 2dashes no

petunia hammering on the door to wake you up semicolonmark at least he got to visit the rest of the house periodmark nextline nextline the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes periodmark slowly commamark very slowly commamark it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry's periodmark nextline nextline it winked periodmark nextline nextline Harry stared periodmark then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching periodmark they weren't periodmark he looked back at the snake and winked commamark too periodmark nextline nextline the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley commamark then raised its eyes to the ceiling periodmark it gave Harry a look that said quite plainly colonmark i get that all the time periodmark nextline nextline i know commamark Harry murmured through the glass commamark though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him periodmark it must be really annoying periodmark nextline nextline the snake nodded vigorously periodmark nextline nextline where do you come from commamark anyway questionmark Harry asked periodmark nextline nextline the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass periodmark Harry

again and Harry read on colonmark this specimen was bred in the zoo periodmark oh commamark i see 2dashes so you've never been to brazil questionmark nextline nextline as the snake shook its head commamark a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump periodmark nextline nextline dudley exclamationmark mr periodmark dursley exclamationmark come and look at this snake exclamationmark

commamark punching Harry in the ribs periodmark caught by surprise commamark Harry fell hard on the concrete floor periodmark what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened 2dashes one

commamark brazil commamark here i come periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark thanksss commamark amigo periodmark nextline nextline the keeper of the reptile house was in shock periodmark nextline nextline but the glass commamark he kept saying commamark where did the glass go questionmark nextline nextline the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong commamark sweet tea while he apologized over and over again periodmark piers and dudley could only gibber periodmark as far as Harry had seen commamark the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels

2dashes and he remembered something else commamark for the first time in his life colonmark a high commamark cold commamark cruel laugh periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid was watching him sadly periodmark nextline nextline took yeh from the ruined house myself commamark on dumbledore's orders periodmark brought yeh ter this lot periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline load of old

meanwhile commamark still had questions to ask commamark hundreds of them periodmark nextline nextline but what happened to vol 2dashes commamark sorry 2dashes i mean commamark you-know-who

periodmark nextline nextline there was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on 2dashes i dunno what it was commamark no one does 2dashes but somethin' about you stumped him commamark all right periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes commamark but Harry commamark instead of feeling pleased and proud commamark felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake periodmark a wizard questionmark him questionmark how could he possibly be questionmark he'd spent his life being clouted by dudley commamark and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon semicolonmark if he was really a wizard commamark why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard questionmark if he'd once defeated

somehow found himself out of their reach periodmark periodmark periodmark dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut commamark he'd managed to make it grow back periodmark periodmark periodmark and the very last time dudley had hit him commamark hadn't he got his revenge commamark without even realizing he was doing it questionmark hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him questionmark Harry looked back at Hagrid commamark smiling commamark and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him periodmark nextline nextline see questionmark said Hagrid periodmark Harry Potter

had finally gone too far periodmark Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head commamark never commamark he thundered commamark - insult- albus- dumbledorein- front- of- me exclamationmark nextline nextline he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley 2dashes there was a flash of violet light commamark a sound like a firecracker commamark a sharp squeal commamark and the next second commamark dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom commamark howling in pain periodmark when he turned his back on them commamark Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers periodmark nextline nextline uncle vernon roared periodmark pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room commamark he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard periodmark nextline nextline shouldn'ta lost me temper commamark he said ruefully commamark but it didn't work anyway periodmark meant ter turn him into a pig commamark but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left

at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall periodmark Hagrid folded up his newspaper commamark and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street periodmark nextline nextline passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station periodmark Harry couldn't blame them periodmark not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else commamark he

turned to griphook periodmark vault seven hundred and thirteen now commamark please commamark and can we go more slowly questionmark nextline nextline one speed only commamark said griphook periodmark nextline nextline they were going even deeper now and gathering speed periodmark the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners periodmark they went rattling over an underground

vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole periodmark nextline nextline stand back commamark said griphook importantly periodmark he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it

nextline nextline something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault commamark Harry was sure commamark and he leaned forward eagerly commamark expecting to see fabulous jewels at

was a tiny place commamark empty except for a single commamark spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait periodmark Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library semicolonmark he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling periodmark for some reason commamark the back of his neck prickled periodmark the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic periodmark nextline nextline good afternoon commamark said a soft voice periodmark Harry jumped periodmark Hagrid must have jumped commamark too commamark because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair periodmark nextline nextline an old man was standing before

ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose periodmark Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes periodmark nextline nextline and that's where periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry's forehead with a long commamark white finger periodmark nextline nextline i'm sorry to say i sold

periodmark nextline nextline Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure commamark which was measuring between his nostrils commamark was doing this on its own periodmark mr periodmark ollivander

wave periodmark nextline nextline Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit commamark but mr periodmark ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once periodmark nextline nextline maple and phoenix feather periodmark seven inches periodmark quite whippy periodmark try 2dashes nextline nextline Harry tried 2dashes but he had hardly raised the wand when it commamark too

nextline funny way to get to a wizards' school commamark the train periodmark magic carpets all got punctures commamark have they questionmark nextline nextline Harry didn't say anything periodmark nextline nextline where is this school commamark anyway questionmark nextline nextline i don't know commamark said Harry commamark realizing this for the first time periodmark he pulled the ticket

the hospital commamark growled uncle vernon periodmark got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings periodmark nextline nextline Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep periodmark he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes 2dashes he'd change on the train periodmark he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed commamark saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage commamark and then paced the room commamark waiting for the dursleys to get up periodmark two hours later commamark harry's huge commamark heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys' car commamark aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to Harry commamark and they had set off periodmark nextline nextline they reached king's cross at half past ten periodmark uncle vernon dumped harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him periodmark Harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead commamark facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face periodmark nextline nextline well commamark there you are commamark boy periodmark platform nine 2dashes platform ten periodmark your platform should be somewhere in the middle commamark but they don't seem to have built it yet commamark do they questionmark nextline nextline he was quite right commamark of course periodmark there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it commamark and in the middle commamark nothing at all periodmark nextline nextline have a good term commamark said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile periodmark he left without another word periodmark Harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away periodmark nextline nextline all three of them were laughing periodmark harry's mouth went rather dry periodmark what on earth was he going to do questionmark he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks commamark because of Hedwig periodmark he'd have to ask someone periodmark nextline nextline he stopped a passing guard commamark but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters periodmark the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in commamark he started to get annoyed commamark as though Harry was being stupid on purpose periodmark getting desperate commamark Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock commamark but the guard said there wasn't one periodmark in the end the guard strode away commamark muttering about time wasters periodmark Harry was now trying hard not to panic periodmark nextline nextline according to the large clock over the arrivals board commamark he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it semicolonmark he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift commamark a pocket full of wizard money commamark and a large owl periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do commamark like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley periodmark he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten periodmark nextline nextline at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying periodmark nextline nextline 2dashes packed with muggles commamark of course 2dashes nextline nextline Harry swung round periodmark the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys commamark all with flaming red hair periodmark each of them was pushing a trunk like harry's in front of him 2dashes and they had an owl periodmark nextline nextline heart hammering commamark Harry pushed his cart after them periodmark they stopped and so did he commamark just near enough to hear what they were saying periodmark nextline nextline now commamark what's the platform number questionmark said the boys' mother periodmark nextline nextline nine and three-quarters exclamationmark piped a small girl commamark also red-headed commamark who was holding her hand commamark mom commamark can't i go periodmark periodmark periodmark “ nextline nextline you're not old enough commamark ginny commamark now be quiet periodmark all right commamark Percy commamark you go first periodmark nextline nextline what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten periodmark nextline nextline Harry watched commamark careful not to blink in case he missed it 2dashes but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms commamark a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away commamark the boy had vanished periodmark nextline nextline Fred commamark you next commamark the plump woman said periodmark nextline nextline i'm not Fred commamark i'm george commamark said the boy periodmark honestly commamark woman commamark you call yourself our mother questionmark cara you tell i'm george questionmark nextline nextline sorry commamark george commamark dear periodmark nextline nextline only joking commamark i am Fred commamark said the boy commamark and off he went periodmark his twin called after him to hurry up commamark and he must have done so commamark because a second later commamark he had gone 2dashes but how had he done it questionmark now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there 2dashes and then commamark quite suddenly commamark he wasn't anywhere periodmark nextline nextline there was nothing else for it periodmark nextline nextline excuse me commamark Harry said to the plump woman periodmark nextline nextline hello commamark dear commamark she said periodmark first time at hogwarts questionmark ron's new commamark too periodmark nextline nextline she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons periodmark he was tall commamark thin commamark and gangling commamark with freckles commamark big hands and feet commamark and a long nose periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark said Harry periodmark the thing is 2dashes the thing is commamark i don't know how to 2dashes nextline nextline how to get onto the platform questionmark she said kindly commamark and Harry nodded periodmark nextline nextline not to worry commamark she said periodmark all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten periodmark don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it commamark that's very important periodmark best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous periodmark go on commamark go now before ron periodmark nextline nextline er 2dashes okay commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier periodmark it looked very solid periodmark nextline nextline he started to walk toward it periodmark people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten periodmark Harry walked more quickly periodmark he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble 2dashes leaning forward on his cart commamark he broke into a heavy run 2dashes the barrier was coming nearer and nearer 2dashes he wouldn't be able to stop 2dashes the cart was out of control 2dashes he was a foot away 2dashes he closed his eyes ready for the crash 2dashes it didn't come periodmark periodmark periodmark he kept on running periodmark periodmark periodmark he opened his eyes periodmark a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people periodmark a sign overhead said hogwarts express commamark eleven o'clock periodmark Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been commamark with the words platform nine and three-quarters on it commamark he had done it periodmark nextline nextline smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd commamark while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs periodmark owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks periodmark nextline nextline the first few carriages were already packed with students commamark some hanging out of the window to talk to their families commamark some fighting over seats periodmark nextline nextline Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat periodmark nextline nextline he passed a round-faced boy who was saying commamark gran commamark i've lost my toad again periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark neville commamark he heard the old woman sigh periodmark nextline nextline a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd periodmark nextline nextline give us a look commamark lee commamark go on periodmark nextline nextline the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms commamark and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long commamark hairy leg periodmark nextline nextline Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train periodmark he put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door periodmark he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot periodmark nextline nextline want a hand questionmark it was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark please commamark Harry panted periodmark nextline nextline oy commamark Fred exclamationmark c'mere and help exclamationmark nextline nextline with the twins' help commamark harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment periodmark nextline nextline thanks commamark said Harry commamark pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes periodmark nextline nextline what's that questionmark said one of the twins suddenly commamark pointing at harry's lightning scar periodmark nextline nextline blimey commamark said the other twin periodmark are you he is commamark said the first twin periodmark aren't you questionmark he added to Harry periodmark nextline nextline what questionmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline Harry

questionmark george questionmark are you there questionmark nextline nextline coming commamark mom periodmark nextline nextline with a last look at Harry commamark the twins hopped off the train periodmark nextline nextline Harry sat down next to the window where commamark half hidden commamark he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying periodmark their mother had just taken out her handkerchief periodmark nextline nextline ron commamark you've got something on your nose periodmark nextline nextline the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way

again periodmark nextline nextline are all your family wizards questionmark asked Harry commamark who found ron just as interesting as ron found him periodmark nextline nextline er 2dashes yes commamark i think so commamark said ron periodmark i think mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant commamark but we never talk about him periodmark nextline nextline so you must know loads of

2dashes i mean commamark i got Scabbers instead periodmark nextline nextline ron's ears went pink periodmark he seemed to think he'd said too much commamark because he went back to staring out of the window periodmark nextline nextline Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl periodmark after all commamark he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago commamark and he told ron so commamark all about having to wear dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents periodmark this seemed to cheer ron up periodmark nextline nextline periodmark periodmark periodmark and until Hagrid told me commamark i didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort nextline nextline ron gasped periodmark nextline nextline what questionmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline you said you-know-who's name exclamationmark said ron commamark sounding both shocked and impressed periodmark i'd have thought you

commamark i bet i'm the worst in the class periodmark nextline nextline you won't be periodmark there's loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough periodmark nextline nextline while they had been talking commamark the train had carried them out of london periodmark nextline nextline now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep periodmark they were quiet for a time commamark watching the fields and lanes flick past periodmark nextline nextline around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling commamark dimpled woman slid back their door and said commamark anything off the cart commamark dears questionmark nextline nextline Harry commamark who hadn't had any breakfast commamark leapt to his feet commamark but ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches periodmark Harry went out into the corridor periodmark nextline nextline he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys commamark and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry 2dashes but the woman didn't have mars bars periodmark what she did have were bettie bott's every flavor beans commamark drooble's best blowing gum commamark chocolate frogs periodmark pumpkin pasties commamark cauldron cakes commamark licorice wands commamark and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life periodmark not wanting to miss anything commamark he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts periodmark nextline nextline ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat periodmark nextline nextline hungry commamark are you questionmark nextline nextline starving commamark said Harry commamark taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty periodmark nextline nextline ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it periodmark there were four sandwiches inside periodmark he pulled one of them apart and said commamark she always forgets i don't like corned beef periodmark nextline nextline swap you for one of these commamark said Harry commamark holding up a pasty periodmark go on 2dashes nextline nextline you don't want this commamark it's all dry commamark said ron periodmark she hasn't got much time commamark he added quickly commamark you know commamark with five of us periodmark nextline nextline go on commamark have a pasty commamark said Harry commamark who had never had anything to share before or commamark indeed commamark anyone to share it with periodmark it was a nice feeling commamark sitting there with ron commamark eating their way through all harry's pasties commamark cakes commamark and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten) periodmark nextline nextline what are these questionmark Harry asked ron commamark holding up a pack of chocolate frogs periodmark nextline nextline they're not really frogs commamark are they questionmark he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him periodmark nextline nextline no commamark said ron periodmark but see what the card is periodmark i'm missing agrippa periodmark nextline nextline what questionmark nextline nextline oh commamark of course commamark you wouldn't know 2dashes chocolate frogs have cards commamark inside them commamark you know commamark to collect 2dashes famous witches and wizards periodmark i've got about five hundred commamark but i haven't got agrippa or ptolemy periodmark nextline nextline Harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card periodmark it showed a man's face periodmark he wore half- moon glasses commamark had a long commamark crooked nose commamark and flowing silver hair commamark beard commamark and mustache periodmark underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline so this is dumbledore exclamationmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline don't tell me you'd never heard of dumbledore exclamationmark said ron periodmark can i have a frog questionmark i might get agrippa 2dashes thanks Harry turned over his card and read colonmark albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times commamark dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 commamark for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood commamark and his work on alchemy with his partner commamark nicolas flamel periodmark Professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling periodmark nextline nextline Harry turned the card back over and saw commamark to his astonishment commamark that dumbledore's face had disappeared periodmark nextline nextline he's gone exclamationmark nextline nextline well commamark you can't expect him to hang around all day commamark said ron periodmark he'll be back periodmark no commamark i've got morgana again and i've got about six of her periodmark periodmark periodmark do you want it questionmark you can start collecting periodmark nextline nextline ron's eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped periodmark nextline nextline help yourself commamark said Harry periodmark but in commamark you know commamark the muggle world commamark people just stay put in photos periodmark nextline nextline do they questionmark what commamark they don't move at all questionmark ron sounded amazed periodmark weird exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile periodmark ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards commamark but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them periodmark soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana commamark but hengist of woodcroft commamark alberic grunnion commamark circe commamark paracelsus commamark and merlin periodmark nextline nextline he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna commamark who was scratching her nose commamark to open a bag of bertie bott's every flavor beans periodmark nextline nextline you want to be careful with those commamark ron warned Harry periodmark when they say every flavor commamark they mean every flavor 2dashes you know commamark you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade commamark but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe periodmark george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once periodmark nextline nextline ron picked up a green bean commamark looked at it carefully commamark and bit into a corner periodmark nextline nextline bleaaargh 2dashes see questionmark sprouts periodmark nextline nextline they had a good time eating the every flavor beans periodmark Harry got toast commamark coconut commamark baked bean commamark strawberry commamark curry commamark grass commamark coffee commamark sardine commamark and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn't touch commamark which turned out to be pepper periodmark nextline nextline the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder periodmark the neat fields had gone periodmark now there were woods commamark twisting rivers commamark and dark green hills periodmark nextline nextline there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in periodmark he looked tearful periodmark nextline nextline sorry commamark he said commamark but have you seen a toad at all questionmark nextline nextline when they shook their heads commamark he wailed commamark i've lost him exclamationmark he keeps getting away from me exclamationmark nextline nextline he'll turn up commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark said the boy miserably periodmark well commamark if you see him periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he left periodmark nextline nextline don't know why he's so bothered commamark said ron periodmark if i'd brought a toad i'd lose it as quick as i could periodmark mind you commamark i brought Scabbers commamark so i can't talk periodmark nextline nextline the rat was still snoozing on ron's lap periodmark nextline nextline he might have died and you wouldn't know the difference commamark said ron in disgust periodmark i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting commamark but the spell didn't work periodmark i'll show you commamark look periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand periodmark it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end periodmark nextline nextline unicorn hair's nearly poking out periodmark anyway he had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again periodmark nextline nextline the toadless boy was back commamark but this time he had a girl with him periodmark she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes periodmark nextline nextline has anyone seen a toad questionmark neville's lost one commamark she said periodmark she had a bossy sort of voice commamark lots of bushy brown hair commamark and rather large front teeth periodmark nextline nextline we've already told him we haven't

that's what's odd periodmark 'course commamark everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you-know-who's behind it periodmark nextline nextline Harry turned this news over in his mind periodmark he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you- know-who was mentioned periodmark he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world commamark but it had been a lot more comfortable saying Voldemort without worrying periodmark nextline nextline what's your quidditch team questionmark ron asked periodmark nextline nextline er 2dashes i don't know any commamark Harry confessed periodmark nextline nextline what exclamationmark ron looked dumbfounded periodmark oh commamark you wait commamark it's the best game in the world 2dashes and he was off commamark

periodmark he was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again commamark but it wasn't neville the toadless boy commamark or Hermione Granger this time periodmark nextline nextline three boys entered commamark and Harry recognized the middle one at once colonmark it was the pale boy from madam malkin's robe shop periodmark he was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in diagon alley periodmark nextline nextline is it true questionmark he said periodmark they're saying all down the train that Harry potter's in

out his hand to shake harry's commamark but Harry didn't take it periodmark nextline nextline i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself commamark thanks commamark he said coolly periodmark nextline nextline Draco Malfoy didn't go red commamark but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks periodmark nextline nextline i'd be careful if i were you commamark Potter commamark he said slowly periodmark unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents periodmark they didn't know what was good for them commamark either periodmark you hang around with riffraff like the

as red as his hair periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark you're going to fight us commamark are you questionmark Malfoy sneered periodmark nextline nextline unless you get out now commamark said Harry commamark more bravely than he felt commamark because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron periodmark nextline nextline but we don't feet like leaving commamark do we commamark boys questionmark we've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some periodmark nextline nextline goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron - ron leapt forward commamark but before he'd so much as touched goyle commamark goyle let out a horrible yell periodmark nextline nextline Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger commamark sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle's knuckle - crabbe and Malfoy backed away as goyle swung Scabbers round and round commamark howling commamark and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window commamark all three of them disappeared at once periodmark perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets commamark or perhaps they'd heard footsteps commamark because a second later commamark Hermione Granger had come in periodmark nextline nextline what has been going on questionmark she said commamark looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up Scabbers by his tail periodmark nextline nextline i think he's been knocked out commamark ron said to Harry periodmark he looked closer at Scabbers periodmark no 2dashes i don't believe it 2dashes he's gone back to sleep- nextline

nextline you'd better hurry up and put your robes on commamark i've just been up to the front to ask the conductor commamark and he says we're nearly there periodmark you haven't been fighting commamark have you questionmark you'll be in trouble before we even get there exclamationmark nextline nextline Scabbers has been fighting commamark not us commamark said ron commamark scowling at her periodmark would you mind leaving while we change questionmark nextline nextline all right 2dashes i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly commamark racing up and down the corridors commamark said Hermione in a sniffy voice periodmark and you've got dirt on your nose commamark by the way commamark did you know questionmark nextline nextline ron glared at her as she left periodmark Harry peered out of the window periodmark it was getting dark periodmark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky periodmark the train did seem to be slowing down periodmark nextline nextline he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes periodmark nextline nextline ron's were a bit short for him commamark you could see his sneakers underneath them periodmark nextline nextline a voice echoed through the train colonmark we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes' time periodmark please leave your luggage on the train commamark it will be taken to the school separately periodmark nextline nextline harry's stomach lurched with nerves and ron commamark he saw commamark looked pale under his freckles periodmark they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor periodmark nextline nextline the train slowed right down and finally stopped periodmark people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny commamark dark platform periodmark Harry shivered in the cold night air periodmark then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students commamark and Harry heard a familiar voice colonmark firs' years exclamationmark firs' years over here exclamationmark all right there commamark Harry questionmark nextline nextline hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads periodmark nextline nextline c'mon commamark follow me 2dashes any more firs' years questionmark mind yer step commamark now exclamationmark firs' years follow me exclamationmark nextline nextline slipping and stumbling commamark they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep commamark narrow path periodmark it was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there periodmark nobody spoke much periodmark neville commamark the boy who kept losing his toad commamark sniffed once or twice periodmark nextline nextline ye' all get yer firs' sight o' hogwarts in a sec commamark Hagrid called over his shoulder commamark jus' round this bend here periodmark nextline nextline there was a loud oooooh exclamationmark nextline nextline the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take periodmark nextline nextline perched atop a high mountain on the other side commamark its windows sparkling in the starry sky commamark was a vast castle with many turrets and towers periodmark nextline nextline no more'n four to a boat exclamationmark Hagrid called commamark pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore periodmark Harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and Hermione periodmark everyone in questionmark shouted Hagrid commamark who had a boat to himself periodmark right then 2dashes forward exclamationmark nextline nextline and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once commamark gliding across the lake commamark which was as smooth as glass periodmark everyone was silent commamark staring up at the great castle overhead periodmark it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood periodmark nextline nextline heads down exclamationmark yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff semicolonmark they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face periodmark they were carried along a dark tunnel commamark which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle commamark until they reached a kind of underground harbor commamark where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles periodmark nextline nextline oy commamark you there exclamationmark is this your toad questionmark said Hagrid commamark who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them periodmark nextline nextline trevor exclamationmark cried neville blissfully commamark holding out his hands periodmark then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid's lamp commamark coming out at last onto smooth commamark damp grass right in the shadow of the castle periodmark nextline nextline they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge commamark oak front door periodmark nextline nextline everyone here questionmark you there commamark still got yer toad questionmark nextline nextline Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door periodmark nextline nextline chapter seven nextline nextline the sorting hat nextline nextline the door swung open at once periodmark a tall commamark black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there periodmark she had a very stern face and harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross periodmark nextline nextline the firs' years commamark Professor McGonagall commamark said Hagrid periodmark nextline nextline thank you commamark Hagrid periodmark i will take them from here periodmark nextline nextline she pulled the door wide periodmark the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys' house in it periodmark the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts commamark the ceiling was too high to make out commamark and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors periodmark nextline nextline they followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor periodmark Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here 2dashes but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small commamark empty chamber off the hall periodmark they crowded in commamark standing rather closer together than they would usually have done commamark peering about nervously periodmark nextline nextline welcome to hogwarts commamark said Professor McGonagall periodmark the start-of-term banquet will begin shortly commamark but before you take your seats in the great hall commamark you will be sorted into your houses periodmark the sorting is a very important ceremony because commamark while you are here commamark your house will be something like your family within hogwarts periodmark you will have classes with the rest of your house commamark sleep in your house dormitory commamark and spend free time in your house common room periodmark nextline nextline the four houses are called gryffindor commamark hufflepuff commamark ravenclaw commamark and slytherin periodmark each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards periodmark while you are at hogwarts commamark your triumphs will earn your house points commamark while any rulebreaking will lose house points periodmark at the end of the year commamark the house with the most points is awarded the house cup commamark a great honor periodmark i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours periodmark nextline nextline the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school periodmark i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting periodmark nextline nextline her eyes lingered for a moment on neville's cloak commamark which was fastened under his left ear commamark and on ron's smudged nose periodmark Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair periodmark nextline nextline i shall return when we are ready for you commamark said Professor McGonagall periodmark nextline nextline please wait quietly periodmark nextline nextline she left the chamber periodmark Harry swallowed periodmark nextline nextline how exactly do they sort us into houses questionmark he asked ron periodmark nextline nextline some sort of test commamark i think periodmark Fred said it hurts a lot commamark but i think he was joking periodmark nextline nextline harry's heart gave a horrible jolt periodmark a test questionmark in front of the whole school questionmark but he didn't know any magic yet 2dashes what on earth would he have to do questionmark he hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived periodmark nextline nextline he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified commamark too periodmark no one was talking much except Hermione Granger commamark who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need periodmark Harry tried hard not to listen to her periodmark he'd never been more nervous commamark never commamark not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue periodmark he kept his eyes fixed on the door periodmark any second now commamark Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom periodmark nextline nextline then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air 2dashes several people behind him screamed periodmark nextline nextline what the 2dashes questionmark nextline nextline he gasped periodmark so did the people around him periodmark about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall periodmark pearly-white and slightly transparent commamark they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years periodmark they seemed to be arguing periodmark what looked like a fat little monk was saying colonmark forgive and forget commamark i say commamark we ought to give him a second chance 2dashes nextline nextline my dear friar commamark haven't we given peeves all the chances he deserves questionmark he gives us all a bad name and you know commamark he's not really even a ghost 2dashes i say commamark what are you all doing here questionmark nextline nextline a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years periodmark nextline nextline nobody answered periodmark nextline nextline new students exclamationmark said the fat friar commamark smiling around at them periodmark about to be sorted commamark i suppose questionmark nextline nextline a few people nodded mutely periodmark nextline nextline hope to see you in hufflepuff exclamationmark said the friar periodmark my old house commamark you know periodmark nextline nextline move along now commamark said a sharp voice periodmark the sorting ceremony's about to start periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall had returned periodmark one by one commamark the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall periodmark nextline nextline now commamark form a line commamark Professor McGonagall told the first years commamark and follow me periodmark nextline nextline feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead commamark Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair commamark with ron behind him commamark and they walked out of the chamber commamark back across the hall commamark and through a pair of double doors into the great hall periodmark nextline nextline Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place periodmark it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables commamark where the rest of the students were sitting periodmark nextline nextline these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets periodmark at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall led the first years up here commamark so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students commamark with the teachers behind them periodmark nextline nextline the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight periodmark dotted here and there among the students commamark the ghosts shone misty silver periodmark mainly to avoid all the staring eyes commamark Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars periodmark he heard Hermione whisper commamark its bewitched to look like the sky outside periodmark i read about it in hogwarts commamark a history periodmark nextline nextline it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all commamark and that the great hall didn't simply open on to the heavens periodmark nextline nextline Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years periodmark on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat periodmark this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty periodmark aunt petunia wouldn't have let it in the house periodmark nextline nextline maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it commamark Harry thought wildly commamark that seemed the sort of thing 2dashes noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat commamark he stared at it commamark too periodmark for a few seconds commamark there was complete silence periodmark then the hat twitched periodmark a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth 2dashes and the hat began to sing colonmark oh commamark you may not think i'm pretty commamark but don't judge on what you see commamark i'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me periodmark nextline nextline you can keep your bowlers black commamark your top hats sleek and tall commamark for i'm the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all periodmark nextline nextline there's nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can't see commamark so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be periodmark nextline nextline you might belong in gryffindor commamark where dwell the brave at heart commamark their daring commamark nerve commamark and chivalry set gryffindors apart semicolonmark you might belong in hufflepuff commamark where they are just and loyal commamark those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil semicolonmark or yet in wise old ravenclaw commamark if you've a ready mind commamark where those of wit and learning commamark will always find their kind semicolonmark or perhaps in slytherin you'll make your real friends commamark those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends periodmark nextline nextline so put me on exclamationmark don't be afraid exclamationmark and don't get in a flap exclamationmark you're in safe hands (though i have none) for i'm a thinking cap exclamationmark nextline nextline the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song periodmark it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again periodmark nextline nextline so we've just got to try on the hat exclamationmark ron whispered to Harry periodmark i'll kill Fred commamark he was going on about wrestling a troll periodmark nextline nextline Harry periodmark smiled weakly periodmark yes commamark trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell commamark but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching periodmark the hat seemed to be asking rather alot semicolonmark Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment periodmark if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy commamark that would have been the one for him periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment periodmark nextline nextline when i call your name commamark you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted commamark she said periodmark Abbott commamark Hannah exclamationmark nextline nextline a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line commamark put on the hat commamark which fell right down over her eyes commamark and sat down periodmark a moments pause 2dashes hufflepuff exclamationmark shouted the hat periodmark nextline nextline the table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table periodmark Harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her periodmark nextline nextline Bones commamark Susan exclamationmark nextline nextline hufflepuff exclamationmark shouted the hat again commamark and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah periodmark nextline nextline boot commamark terry exclamationmark nextline nextline ravenclaw exclamationmark nextline nextline the table second from the left clapped this time semicolonmark several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them periodmark nextline nextline brocklehurst commamark mandy went to ravenclaw too commamark but brown commamark lavender nextline nextline became the first new gryffindor commamark and the table on the far left exploded with cheers semicolonmark Harry could see ron's twin brothers catcalling periodmark nextline nextline bulstrode commamark millicent then became a slytherin periodmark perhaps it was harry's imagination commamark after all he'd heard about slytherin commamark but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot periodmark he was starting to feel definitely sick now periodmark he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school periodmark nextline nextline he had always been last to be chosen commamark not because he was no good commamark but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him periodmark nextline nextline finch-fletchley commamark justin exclamationmark nextline nextline hufflepuff exclamationmark nextline nextline sometimes commamark Harry noticed commamark the hat shouted out the house at once commamark but at others it took a little while to decide periodmark finnigan commamark seamus commamark the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line commamark sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor periodmark nextline nextline Granger commamark Hermione exclamationmark nextline nextline Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head periodmark nextline nextline gryffindor exclamationmark shouted the hat periodmark ron groaned periodmark nextline nextline a horrible thought struck Harry commamark as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous periodmark what if he wasn't chosen at all questionmark what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages commamark until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train questionmark when neville longbottom commamark the boy who kept losing his toad commamark was called commamark he fell over on his way to the stool periodmark the hat took a long time to decide with neville periodmark when it finally shouted commamark gryffindor commamark neville ran off still wearing it commamark and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal commamark morag periodmark nextline nextline Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once colonmark the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed commamark slytherin exclamationmark nextline nextline Malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle commamark looking pleased with himself periodmark nextline nextline there weren't many people left now periodmark moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls commamark patil and patil then perks commamark sally-anne and then commamark at last 2dashes Potter commamark Harry exclamationmark nextline nextline as Harry stepped forward commamark whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall periodmark nextline nextline Potter commamark did she say questionmark nextline nextline the Harry Potter questionmark nextline nextline the last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him periodmark next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat periodmark he waited periodmark nextline nextline hmm commamark said a small voice in his ear periodmark difficult periodmark very difficult periodmark plenty of courage commamark i see periodmark not a bad mind either periodmark there's talent commamark a my goodness commamark yes 2dashes and a nice thirst to prove yourself commamark now that's interesting periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline so where shall i put you questionmark nextline nextline Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought commamark not slytherin commamark

here in your head commamark and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness commamark no doubt about that 2dashes no questionmark well commamark if you're sure 2dashes better be gryffindor exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall periodmark he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table periodmark he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin commamark he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet periodmark Percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously commamark while the Weasley twins yelled commamark we got Potter exclamationmark we got Potter exclamationmark Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier periodmark the ghost patted his arm commamark giving Harry the sudden commamark horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water periodmark nextline nextline he could see the high table properly now periodmark at the end nearest him sat Hagrid commamark who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up periodmark Harry grinned back periodmark and there commamark in the center of the high table commamark in a large gold chair commamark sat albus dumbledore periodmark Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train periodmark dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in

exclamationmark nextline nextline the gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds commamark out of the great hall commamark and up the marble staircase periodmark harry's legs

periodmark nextline nextline the bloody baron's the only one who can control him commamark he won't even listen to us prefects periodmark here we are periodmark nextline nextline at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress periodmark nextline nextline password questionmark she said periodmark caput draconis commamark said Percy commamark and the

a cozy commamark round room full of squashy armchairs periodmark nextline nextline Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another periodmark at the top of a

chapter eight nextline nextline the potions master nextline nextline there commamark look periodmark nextline nextline where questionmark nextline nextline next to the tall kid with the red hair

there were a hundred and forty-two staircases at hogwarts colonmark wide commamark sweeping ones semicolonmark narrow commamark rickety ones semicolonmark some that led somewhere different on a friday semicolonmark some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump periodmark then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely commamark or tickled them in exactly the right place commamark and doors that weren't really doors at all commamark but solid walls just pretending periodmark it was also very hard to remember where anything was commamark because it all seemed to move around a lot periodmark the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other commamark and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk periodmark nextline nextline the ghosts didn't help commamark either periodmark it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open periodmark nearly headless Nick was always happy to point

good kick periodmark nextline nextline and then commamark once you had managed to find them commamark there were the classes themselves periodmark there was a lot more to magic commamark as Harry quickly found out commamark than waving your wand and saying a few funny words periodmark nextline nextline they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets periodmark three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology commamark with a dumpy little

most boring class was history of magic commamark which was the only one taught by a ghost periodmark Professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire

again different periodmark Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross periodmark strict and clever commamark she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class periodmark nextline nextline transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts commamark she said periodmark anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back periodmark you have been warned periodmark nextline nextline then she changed her desk into a pig and back again periodmark they were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started commamark but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time periodmark nextline nextline after taking a lot of complicated notes commamark they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle periodmark by the end of the lesson commamark only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match semicolonmark Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile periodmark nextline nextline the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts commamark but quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke periodmark his classroom smelled strongly of garlic commamark which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days periodmark his turban commamark he told them commamark had been given to him by an african prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie commamark but they weren't sure they believed this story periodmark nextline nextline for one thing commamark when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie commamark quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather semicolonmark for another commamark they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban commamark and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well commamark so that quirrell was protected wherever he went periodmark nextline nextline Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else periodmark lots of people had come from muggle families and commamark like him commamark hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards periodmark there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn't have much of a head start periodmark nextline nextline friday was an important day for Harry and ron periodmark they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once periodmark nextline nextline what have we got today questionmark Harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge periodmark nextline nextline double potions with the slytherins commamark said ron periodmark snape's head of slytherin house periodmark they say he always favors them 2dashes we'll be able to see if it's true periodmark nextline nextline wish McGonagall favored us commamark said Harry periodmark Professor McGonagall was head of gryffindor house commamark but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before periodmark nextline nextline just then commamark the mail arrived periodmark Harry had gotten used to this by now commamark but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning commamark when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast commamark circling the tables until they saw their owners commamark and dropping letters and packages onto their laps periodmark nextline nextline Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far periodmark she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls periodmark this morning commamark however commamark she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry's plate periodmark Harry tore it open at once periodmark it said commamark in a very untidy scrawl colonmark dear Harry commamark i know you get friday afternoons off commamark so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three questionmark i want to hear all about your first week periodmark send us an answer back with Hedwig periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid Harry borrowed ron's quill commamark scribbled yes commamark please commamark see you later on the back of the note commamark and sent Hedwig off again periodmark nextline nextline it was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to commamark because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far periodmark nextline nextline at the start-of-term banquet commamark Harry had gotten the idea that Professor snape disliked him periodmark by the end of the first potions lesson commamark he knew he'd been wrong periodmark snape didn't dislike Harry 2dashes he hated him periodmark nextline nextline potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons periodmark it was colder here than up in the main castle commamark and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls periodmark nextline nextline snape commamark like flitwick commamark started the class by taking the roll call commamark and like flitwick commamark he paused at harry's name periodmark nextline nextline ah commamark yes commamark he said softly commamark Harry Potter periodmark our new 2dashes celebrity periodmark nextline nextline Draco Malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands periodmark snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class periodmark his eyes were black like hagrid's commamark but they had none of hagrid's warmth periodmark nextline nextline they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels periodmark nextline nextline you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking commamark he began periodmark he spoke in barely more than a whisper commamark but they caught every word 2dashes like Professor McGonagall commamark snape had y caught every word 2dashes like Professor McGonagall commamark snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort periodmark as there is little foolish wand-waving here commamark many of you will hardly believe this is magic periodmark i don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes commamark the delicate power of liquids

commamark even stopper death 2dashes if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach periodmark nextline nextline more silence followed this little speech periodmark Harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows periodmark Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead periodmark nextline nextline Potter exclamationmark said snape suddenly periodmark what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood questionmark nextline nextline powdered root of what to an infusion of what questionmark Harry glanced at ron commamark who looked as stumped as he was semicolonmark hermione's hand had shot into the air periodmark nextline nextline i don't know commamark sit commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline snape's lips curled into a sneer periodmark nextline nextline tut commamark tut 2dashes fame clearly isn't everything periodmark nextline nextline he ignored hermione's hand periodmark nextline nextline let's try again periodmark Potter commamark where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar questionmark nextline nextline Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat commamark but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was periodmark he tried not to look at Malfoy commamark crabbe commamark and goyle commamark who were shaking with laughter periodmark nextline nextline i don't know commamark sit periodmark thought you wouldn't open a book before coming commamark eh commamark Potter questionmark Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes periodmark he had looked through his books at the dursleys' commamark but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi questionmark snape was still ignoring hermione's quivering hand periodmark nextline nextline what is the difference commamark Potter commamark between monkshood and wolfsbane questionmark nextline nextline at this commamark Hermione stood up commamark her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling periodmark nextline nextline i don't know commamark said Harry quietly periodmark i think Hermione does commamark though commamark why don't you try her questionmark nextline nextline a few people laughed semicolonmark Harry caught seamus's eye commamark and seamus winked periodmark nextline nextline snape commamark however commamark was not pleased periodmark nextline nextline sit down commamark he snapped at Hermione periodmark for your information commamark Potter commamark asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death periodmark a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons periodmark as for monkshood and wolfsbane commamark they are the same plant commamark which also goes by the name of aconite periodmark well questionmark why aren't you all copying that down questionmark nextline nextline there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment periodmark over the noise commamark snape said commamark and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek commamark Potter periodmark nextline nextline things didn't improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued periodmark snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils periodmark he swept around in his long black cloak commamark watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs commamark criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy commamark whom he seemed to like periodmark he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon periodmark neville had somehow managed to melt seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob commamark and their potion was seeping across the stone floor commamark burning holes in people's shoes periodmark within seconds commamark the whole class was standing on their stools while neville commamark who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed commamark moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs periodmark nextline nextline idiot boy exclamationmark snarled snape commamark clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand periodmark i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire questionmark nextline nextline neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose periodmark nextline nextline take him up to the hospital wing commamark snape spat at seamus periodmark then he rounded on Harry and ron commamark who had been working next to neville periodmark nextline nextline you 2dashes Potter 2dashes why didn't you tell him not to add the quills questionmark thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong commamark did you questionmark that's another point you've lost for gryffindor periodmark nextline nextline this was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue commamark but ron kicked him behind their cauldron periodmark nextline nextline doi* push it commamark he muttered commamark i've heard snape can turn very nasty periodmark nextline nextline as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later commamark harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low periodmark he'd lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week 2dashes why did snape hate him so much questionmark cheer up commamark nextline nextline said ron commamark snape's always taking points off Fred and george periodmark can i come and meet Hagrid with you questionmark nextline nextline at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds periodmark Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest periodmark a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door periodmark nextline nextline when Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks periodmark then hagrid's voice rang out commamark saying commamark back commamark

periodmark nextline nextline make yerselves at home commamark said Hagrid commamark letting go of fang commamark who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears periodmark like Hagrid commamark fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked periodmark nextline nextline this is ron commamark Harry told Hagrid commamark who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock

nextline nextline rubbish exclamationmark said Hagrid periodmark why should he questionmark nextline nextline yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that periodmark nextline nextline how's yer brother charlie questionmark Hagrid asked ron periodmark i liked him a lot 2dashes great with animals periodmark nextline nextline Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose periodmark while ron told Hagrid all about charlie's work with dragons commamark Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy

package periodmark had that been what the thieves were looking for questionmark as Harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner commamark their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse commamark Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid periodmark had Hagrid collected that package just in time questionmark where was it now questionmark and did Hagrid know something about snape that he didn't want to tell Harry questionmark chapter nine nextline nextline the midnight duel nextline nextline Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley commamark but that was before he met Draco Malfoy periodmark still commamark first-year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins commamark so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much periodmark or at least commamark they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan periodmark nextline nextline flying lessons would be starting on thursday 2dashes and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together periodmark nextline nextline typical commamark said Harry darkly periodmark just what i always wanted periodmark to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy periodmark nextline nextline he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else periodmark nextline nextline you don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself commamark said ron reasonably periodmark anyway commamark i know malfoy's always going on about how good he is at quidditch commamark but i bet that's all talk periodmark nextline nextline malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot periodmark he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long commamark boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters periodmark he wasn't the only one commamark though colonmark the way seamus finnigan told it commamark he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick periodmark even ron would tell anyone who'd listen about

periodmark Harry had caught ron prodding dean's poster of west ham soccer team commamark trying to make the players move periodmark nextline nextline neville had never been on a broomstick in his life commamark because his grandmother had never let him near one periodmark privately commamark Harry felt she'd had good reason commamark because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground periodmark nextline nextline Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was periodmark this was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book 2dashes not that she hadn't tried periodmark at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages periodmark neville was hanging on to her every word commamark desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later commamark but everybody else was very pleased when hermione's

spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection periodmark it's either really valuable or really dangerous commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline or both commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long commamark they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues periodmark nextline nextline neither neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor periodmark all neville cared about was never going near the dog again periodmark nextline nextline Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and ron commamark but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus periodmark all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy commamark and to their great delight commamark just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later periodmark nextline nextline as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual commamark everyone's attention was caught at once by a long commamark thin package carried by six large screech owls periodmark Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel commamark and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him commamark knocking his bacon to the floor periodmark they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel periodmark nextline nextline Harry ripped open the letter first commamark which was lucky commamark because it said colonmark do not open the parcel at the table periodmark nextline nextline it contains your new nimbus two thousand commamark but i don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one periodmark oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read periodmark nextline nextline a nimbus two thousand exclamationmark ron moaned enviously periodmark i've never even touched one periodmark nextline nextline they left the hall quickly commamark wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class commamark but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle periodmark Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it periodmark nextline nextline that's a broomstick commamark he said commamark throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face periodmark you'll be in for it this time commamark Potter commamark first years aren't allowed them periodmark nextline nextline ron couldn't resist it periodmark nextline nextline it's not any old broomstick commamark he said commamark it's a nimbus two thousand periodmark nextline nextline what did you say you've got at home commamark Malfoy commamark a comet two sixty questionmark ron grinned at Harry periodmark comets look flashy commamark but they're not in the same league as the nimbus periodmark nextline nextline what would you know about it commamark Weasley commamark you couldn't afford half the handle commamark Malfoy snapped back periodmark i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig periodmark nextline nextline before ron could answer commamark Professor flitwick appeared at malfoy's elbow periodmark nextline nextline not arguing commamark i hope commamark boys questionmark he squeaked periodmark nextline nextline potter's been sent a broomstick commamark Professor commamark said Malfoy quickly periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark yes commamark that's right commamark said Professor flitwick commamark beaming at Harry periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances commamark Potter periodmark and what model is it questionmark nextline nextline a nimbus two thousand commamark sit commamark said Harry commamark fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy's face periodmark and it's really thanks to Malfoy here that i've got it commamark he added periodmark nextline nextline Harry and ron headed upstairs commamark smothering their laughter at malfoy's obvious rage and confusion periodmark well commamark it's true commamark Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase commamark if he hadn't stolen neville's remembrall i wouln't be on the team periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline so i suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules questionmark came an angry voice from just behind them periodmark Hermione was stomping up the stairs commamark looking disapprovingly at the package in harry's hand periodmark nextline nextline i thought you weren't speaking to us questionmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark don't stop now commamark said ron commamark it's doing us so much good periodmark nextline nextline Hermione marched away with her nose in the air periodmark nextline nextline Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day periodmark it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed commamark or straying off to the quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night periodmark he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating commamark and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last periodmark nextline nextline wow commamark ron sighed commamark as the broomstick rolled onto harry's bedspread periodmark nextline nextline even Harry commamark who knew nothing about the different brooms commamark thought it looked wonderful periodmark sleek and shiny commamark with a mahogany handle commamark it had a long tail of neat commamark straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top periodmark nextline nextline as seven o'clock drew nearer commamark Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field periodmark held never been inside the stadium before periodmark hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on periodmark at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end periodmark they reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through commamark except that they were fifty feet high periodmark nextline nextline too eager to fly again to wait for wood commamark Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground periodmark what a feeling 2dashes he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field periodmark the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch periodmark nextline nextline hey commamark Potter commamark come down exclamationmark' oliver wood had arrived periodmark fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm periodmark Harry landed next to him periodmark nextline nextline very nice commamark said wood commamark his eyes glinting periodmark i see what McGonagall meant periodmark periodmark periodmark you really are a natural periodmark i'm just going to teach you the rules this evening commamark then you'll be joining team practice three times a week periodmark nextline nextline he opened the crate periodmark inside were four different-sized balls periodmark nextline nextline right commamark said wood periodmark now commamark quidditch is easy enough to understand commamark even if it's not too easy to play periodmark there are seven players on each side periodmark nextline nextline three of them are called chasers periodmark nextline nextline three chasers commamark Harry repeated commamark as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball periodmark nextline nextline this ball's called the quaffle commamark said wood periodmark the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal periodmark ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops periodmark follow me questionmark nextline nextline the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score commamark nextline nextline Harry recited periodmark so 2dashes that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops commamark isn't it questionmark nextline nextline what's basketball questionmark said wood curiously periodmark never mind commamark said Harry quickly periodmark nextline nextline now commamark there's another player on each side who's called the keeper -i'm keeper for gryffindor periodmark i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring periodmark nextline nextline three chasers commamark one keeper commamark said Harry commamark who was determined to remember it all periodmark and they play with the quaffle periodmark okay commamark got that periodmark so what are they for questionmark he pointed at the three balls left inside the box periodmark nextline nextline i'll show you now commamark said wood periodmark take this periodmark nextline nextline he handed Harry a small club commamark a bit like a short baseball bat periodmark nextline nextline i'm going to show you what the bludgers do commamark wood said periodmark these two are the bludgers periodmark nextline nextline he showed Harry two identical balls commamark jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle periodmark Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box periodmark nextline nextline stand back commamark wood warned Harry periodmark he bent down and freed one of the bludgers periodmark nextline nextline at once commamark the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry's face periodmark Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose commamark and sent it zigzagging away into the air 2dashes it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood commamark who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground periodmark nextline nextline see questionmark wood panted commamark forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely periodmark the bludgers rocket around commamark trying to knock players off their brooms periodmark that's why you have two beaters on each team 2dashes the Weasley twins are ours 2dashes it's their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team periodmark so 2dashes think you've got all that questionmark nextline nextline three chasers try and score with the quaffle semicolonmark the keeper guards the goal posts semicolonmark the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team commamark Harry reeled off periodmark nextline nextline very good commamark said wood periodmark nextline nextline er 2dashes have the bludgers ever killed anyone questionmark Harry asked commamark hoping he sounded offhand periodmark nextline nextline never at hogwarts periodmark we've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that periodmark now commamark the last member of the team is the seeker periodmark that's you periodmark and you don't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open periodmark nextline nextline don't worry commamark the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers 2dashes i mean commamark they're like a pair of human bludgers themselves periodmark nextline nextline wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball periodmark nextline nextline compared with the quaffle and the bludgers commamark it was tiny commamark about the size of a large walnut periodmark it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings periodmark nextline nextline this commamark said wood commamark is the golden snitch commamark and it's the most important ball of the lot periodmark it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see periodmark it's the seeker's job to catch it periodmark you've got to weave in and out of the chasers commamark beaters commamark bludgers commamark and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker commamark because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points commamark so they nearly always win periodmark that's why seekers get fouled so much periodmark a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught commamark so it can go on for ages 2dashes i think the record is three months commamark they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep periodmark well commamark that's it 2dashes any questions questionmark nextline nextline Harry shook his head periodmark he understood what he had to do all right commamark it was doing it that was going to be the problem periodmark nextline nextline we won't practice with the snitch yet commamark said wood commamark carefully shutting it back inside the crate commamark it's too dark commamark we might lose it periodmark let's try you out with a few of these periodmark nextline nextline he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later commamark he and Harry were up in the air commamark wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch periodmark nextline nextline Harry didn't miss a single one commamark and wood was delighted periodmark after half an hour commamark night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on periodmark nextline nextline that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year commamark said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle periodmark i wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than charlie Weasley commamark and he could have played for england if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons periodmark nextline nextline perhaps it was because he was now so busy commamark what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework commamark but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at hogwarts two months periodmark the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had periodmark his lessons commamark too commamark were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics periodmark nextline nextline on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors periodmark even better commamark Professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly commamark something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make neville's toad zoom around the classroom periodmark Professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice periodmark harry's partner was seamus finnigan (which was a relief commamark because neville had been trying to catch his eye) periodmark ron commamark however commamark was to be working with Hermione Granger periodmark it was hard to tell whether ron or Hermione was angrier about this periodmark she hadn't spoken to either of them since the day harry's broomstick had arrived periodmark nextline nextline now commamark don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing exclamationmark nextline nextline squeaked Professor flitwick commamark perched on top of his pile of books as usual periodmark swish and flick commamark remember commamark swish and flick periodmark and saying the magic words properly is very important commamark too 2dashes never forget wizard baruffio commamark who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest periodmark nextline nextline it was very difficult periodmark Harry and seamus swished and flicked commamark but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop periodmark seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it 2dashes Harry had to put it out with his hat periodmark nextline nextline ron commamark at the next table commamark wasn't having much more luck periodmark nextline nextline wingardium leviosa exclamationmark he shouted commamark waving his long arms like a windmill periodmark nextline nextline you're saying it wrong commamark Harry heard Hermione snap periodmark it's wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa commamark make the 'gar' nice and long periodmark nextline nextline you do it commamark then commamark if you're so clever commamark ron snarled periodmark nextline nextline Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown commamark flicked her wand commamark and said commamark wingardium leviosa exclamationmark nextline nextline their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark well done exclamationmark cried Professor flitwick commamark clapping periodmark everyone see here commamark miss granger's done it exclamationmark nextline nextline ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class periodmark it's no wonder no one can stand her commamark he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor commamark she's a nightmare commamark honestly periodmark “ nextline nextline someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him periodmark it was Hermione periodmark nextline nextline Harry caught a glimpse of her face 2dashes and was startled to see that she was in tears periodmark nextline nextline i think she heard you periodmark nextline nextline so questionmark said ron commamark but he looked a bit uncomfortable periodmark she must've noticed she's got no friends periodmark nextline nextline Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon periodmark on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast commamark Harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone periodmark nextline nextline ron looked still more awkward at this commamark but a moment later they had entered the great hall commamark where the halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds periodmark nextline nextline a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds commamark making the candles in the pumpkins stutter periodmark the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates commamark as it had at the start-of-term banquet periodmark nextline nextline Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall commamark his turban askew and terror on his face periodmark nextline nextline everyone stared as he reached Professor dumbledore's chair commamark slumped against the table commamark and gasped commamark troll 2dashes in the dungeons 2dashes thought you ought to know periodmark nextline nextline he then sank to the floor in a dead faint periodmark nextline nextline there was an uproar periodmark it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor dumbledore's wand to bring silence periodmark nextline nextline prefects commamark he rumbled commamark lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately exclamationmark nextline nextline Percy was in his element periodmark nextline nextline follow me exclamationmark stick together commamark first years exclamationmark no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders exclamationmark stay close behind me commamark now periodmark make way commamark first years coming through exclamationmark excuse me commamark i'm a prefect exclamationmark nextline nextline how could a troll get in questionmark Harry asked as they climbed the stairs periodmark nextline nextline don't ask me commamark they're supposed to be really stupid commamark said ron periodmark maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke periodmark nextline nextline they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions periodmark nextline nextline as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs commamark Harry suddenly grabbed ron's arm periodmark nextline nextline i've just thought 2dashes Hermione periodmark nextline nextline what about her questionmark nextline nextline she doesn't know about the troll periodmark nextline nextline ron bit his lip periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark all right commamark he snapped periodmark but percy'd better not see us periodmark nextline nextline ducking down commamark they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way commamark slipped down a deserted side corridor commamark and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom periodmark they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them periodmark nextline nextline Percy exclamationmark hissed ron commamark pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin periodmark nextline nextline peering around it commamark however commamark they saw not Percy but snape periodmark he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view periodmark nextline nextline what's he doing questionmark Harry whispered periodmark why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers questionmark nextline nextline search me periodmark nextline nextline quietly as possible commamark they crept along the next corridor after snape's fading footsteps periodmark nextline nextline he's heading for the third floor commamark Harry said commamark but ron held up his hand periodmark nextline nextline can you smell something questionmark nextline nextline Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils commamark a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean periodmark nextline nextline and then they heard it 2dashes a low grunting commamark and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet periodmark ron pointed 2dashes at the end of a passage to the left commamark something huge was moving toward them periodmark they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight periodmark nextline nextline it was a horrible sight periodmark twelve feet tall commamark its skin was a dull commamark granite gray commamark its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut periodmark it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat commamark horny feet periodmark the smell coming from it was incredible periodmark it was holding a huge wooden club commamark which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long periodmark nextline nextline the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside periodmark it waggled its long ears commamark making up its tiny mind commamark then slouched slowly into the room periodmark nextline nextline the keys in the lock commamark Harry muttered periodmark we could lock it in periodmark nextline nextline good idea commamark said ron nervously periodmark nextline nextline they edged toward the open door commamark mouths dry commamark praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it periodmark with one great leap commamark Harry managed to grab the key commamark slam the door commamark and lock it periodmark nextline nextline 'yes exclamationmark nextline nextline flushed with their victory commamark they started to run back up the passage commamark but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop 2dashes a high commamark petrified scream 2dashes and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark no commamark said ron commamark pale as the bloody baron periodmark nextline nextline it's the girls' bathroom exclamationmark Harry gasped periodmark nextline nextline Hermione exclamationmark they said together periodmark nextline nextline it was the last thing they wanted to do commamark but what choice did they have questionmark wheeling around commamark they sprinted back to the door and turned the key commamark fumbling in their panic periodmark Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside periodmark nextline nextline Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite commamark looking as if she was about to faint periodmark the troll was advancing on her commamark knocking the sinks off the walls as it went periodmark nextline nextline confuse it exclamationmark Harry said desperately to ron commamark and commamark seizing a tap commamark he threw it as hard as he could against the wall periodmark nextline nextline the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione periodmark it lumbered around commamark blinking stupidly commamark to see what had made the noise periodmark its mean little eyes saw Harry periodmark it hesitated commamark then made for him instead commamark lifting its club as it went periodmark nextline nextline oy commamark pea-brain exclamationmark yelled ron from the other side of the chamber commamark and he threw a metal pipe at it periodmark the troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder commamark but it heard the yell and paused again commamark turning its ugly snout toward ron instead commamark giving Harry time to run around it periodmark nextline nextline come on commamark run commamark run exclamationmark Harry yelled at Hermione commamark trying to pull her toward the door commamark but she couldn't move commamark she was still flat against the wall commamark her mouth open with terror periodmark nextline nextline the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk periodmark it roared again and started toward ron commamark who was nearest and had no way to escape periodmark nextline nextline Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid colonmark he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind periodmark the troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there commamark but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose commamark and harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped 2dashes it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils periodmark nextline nextline howling with pain commamark the troll twisted and flailed its club commamark with Harry clinging on for dear life semicolonmark any second commamark the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club periodmark nextline nextline Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright semicolonmark ron pulled out his own wand 2dashes not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head

and dropped commamark with a sickening crack commamark onto its owner's head periodmark the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face commamark with a thud that made the whole room

done periodmark nextline nextline it was Hermione who spoke first periodmark nextline nextline is it 2dashes dead questionmark nextline nextline i don't think so commamark said Harry commamark i think it's just been knocked out periodmark nextline nextline he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose periodmark it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue periodmark nextline nextline urgh 2dashes troll boogers periodmark nextline nextline he wiped it on the troll's trousers periodmark nextline nextline a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up periodmark nextline nextline they hadn't realized what a racket they had been making commamark but of course commamark someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars periodmark a moment later commamark Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room commamark closely followed by snape commamark with quirrell bringing up the rear periodmark quirrell took one look at the

nextline ron dropped his wand periodmark Hermione Granger commamark telling a downright lie to a teacher questionmark if they hadn't found me commamark i'd be dead now periodmark Harry stuck his wand

Harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them periodmark nextline nextline well 2dashes in that case periodmark periodmark periodmark said Professor McGonagall commamark staring at the three of them commamark miss Granger commamark you foolish girl commamark how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own questionmark nextline nextline Hermione hung her head periodmark Harry was speechless periodmark Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules commamark and here she was commamark pretending she had commamark to get them out of trouble periodmark it was as if snape had started handing out sweets periodmark nextline nextline miss Granger commamark five points will be taken from gryffindor for this commamark said Professor McGonagall periodmark i'm very disappointed in you periodmark if you're not hurt at all commamark you'd better get off to gryffindor tower periodmark students are finishing the feast in their houses periodmark nextline nextline Hermione left periodmark nextline nextline Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and ron periodmark nextline nextline well commamark i still say you were lucky commamark but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll periodmark you each win gryffindor five points periodmark Professor dumbledore will be informed of this periodmark you may go periodmark nextline nextline they hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up periodmark it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll commamark quite apart from anything else periodmark nextline nextline we should have gotten more than ten points commamark ron grumbled periodmark nextline nextline five commamark you mean commamark once she's taken off hermione's periodmark nextline nextline good of her to get us out of trouble like that commamark ron admitted periodmark mind you commamark we did save her periodmark nextline nextline she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her commamark Harry reminded him periodmark nextline nextline they had reached the portrait of the fat lady periodmark nextline nextline pig

however commamark stood alone by the door commamark waiting for them periodmark there was a very embarrassed pause periodmark then commamark none of them looking at each other commamark they all said thanks commamark and hurried off to get plates periodmark nextline nextline but from that moment on commamark Hermione Granger became their friend periodmark there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other commamark and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them periodmark nextline nextline chapter eleven nextline nextline quidditch nextline nextline as

gryffindor versus slytherin periodmark if gryffindor won commamark they would move up into second place in the house championship periodmark nextline nextline hardly anyone had seen Harry play because

commamark and Harry didn't know which was worse 2dashes people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress periodmark nextline nextline it was really lucky that Harry now had hermlone as a friend periodmark he didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her commamark what with all the last-minute quidditch practice wood was making them do periodmark she had also tent him quidditch through the ages commamark which turned out to be a very interesting read periodmark nextline nextline Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 semicolonmark that seekers were usually the smallest and

vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert periodmark nextline nextline Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll commamark and she was much nicer for it periodmark the day before harry's first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break commamark and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar periodmark nextline nextline they were standing with their backs to it commamark getting warm commamark when snape crossed the yard

nextline nextline worst of all were Professor snape's classes down in the dungeons commamark where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons periodmark nextline nextline i do feel so sorry commamark said Draco Malfoy commamark one potions class commamark for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they're not

commamark he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as seeker next periodmark then he'd realized that nobody found this funny commamark because

and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it periodmark nextline nextline hi commamark Hagrid commamark want any help questionmark ron asked commamark sticking his head through the

nextline nextline ah commamark Hagrid commamark the last tree 2dashes put it in the far corner commamark would you questionmark nextline nextline the hall looked spectacular periodmark festoons of

hundreds of candles periodmark nextline nextline how many days you got left until yer holidays questionmark Hagrid asked periodmark nextline nextline just one commamark said Hermione periodmark and that reminds me -harry commamark ron commamark we've got half an hour before lunch commamark we should be in the library periodmark nextline nextline oh yeah commamark you're right commamark said ron commamark tearing his eyes away from Professor flitwick commamark who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree periodmark nextline nextline the library questionmark said Hagrid commamark following them out of the hall periodmark just before the holidays questionmark bit keen commamark aren't yeh questionmark nextline nextline oh commamark we're not working commamark Harry told him brightly periodmark ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we've been trying to find out who he is periodmark nextline nextline you what questionmark Hagrid

periodmark nextline nextline just have to find out for ourselves commamark then commamark said ron commamark and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library periodmark nextline nextline they had indeed been searching books for flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip commamark because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal questionmark the trouble was commamark it was very hard to know where to begin commamark not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book periodmark he wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century commamark or notable magical names of our time semicolonmark he was missing commamark too commamark from important modern magical discoveries commamark and a study of recent developments in wizardry periodmark and then commamark of course commamark there was the sheer size of the library semicolonmark tens of thousands of books semicolonmark thousands of shelves semicolonmark hundreds of narrow rows periodmark nextline nextline Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random periodmark Harry wandered over to the restricted section periodmark he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn't somewhere in there periodmark unfortunately commamark you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books commamark and he knew he'd never get one periodmark these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts commamark and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts periodmark nextline nextline what are you looking for commamark boy questionmark nextline nextline nothing commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him periodmark nextline nextline you'd better get out commamark then periodmark go on 2dashes out exclamationmark nextline nextline wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story commamark Harry left the library periodmark he commamark ron commamark and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel periodmark they were sure she'd be able to tell them commamark but they couldn't risk snape hearing what they were up to periodmark nextline nextline Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything commamark but he wasn't very hopeful periodmark they had been looking for two weeks commamark after a commamark but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing periodmark what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks periodmark nextline nextline five minutes later commamark ron and Hermione joined him commamark shaking their heads periodmark nextline nextline they went off to lunch periodmark nextline nextline you will keep looking while i'm away commamark won't you questionmark said Hermione periodmark and send me an owl if you find anything periodmark nextline nextline and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline it'd be safe to ask them periodmark nextline nextline very safe commamark as they're both dentists commamark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline once the holidays had started commamark ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel periodmark they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual commamark so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire periodmark they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork 2dashes bread commamark english muffins commamark marshmallows 2dashes and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled commamark which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work periodmark nextline nextline ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess periodmark this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive commamark which made it a lot like directing troops in battle periodmark ron's set was very old and battered periodmark nextline nextline like everything else he owned commamark it had once belonged to someone else in his family 2dashes in this case commamark his grandfather periodmark however commamark old chessmen weren't a drawback at all periodmark ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted periodmark nextline nextline Harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him commamark and they didn't trust him at all periodmark he wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him commamark which was confusing periodmark don't send me there commamark can't you see his knight questionmark send him commamark we can afford to lose him periodmark on christmas eve commamark Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun commamark but not expecting any presents at all periodmark nextline nextline when he woke early in the morning commamark however commamark the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed periodmark nextline nextline merry christmas commamark said ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe periodmark nextline nextline you commamark too commamark said Harry periodmark will you look at this questionmark i've got some presents exclamationmark nextline nextline what did you expect commamark turnips questionmark said ron commamark turning to his own pile commamark which was a lot bigger than harry's periodmark nextline nextline Harry picked up the top parcel periodmark it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to Harry commamark from Hagrid periodmark inside was a roughly cut wooden flute periodmark Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself periodmark Harry blew it 2dashes it sounded a bit like an owl periodmark nextline nextline a second commamark very small parcel contained a note periodmark nextline nextline we received your message and enclose your christmas present periodmark from uncle vernon and aunt petunia periodmark taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece periodmark nextline nextline that's friendly commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline ron was fascinated by the fifty pence periodmark nextline nextline weird exclamationmark he said commamark 'nmat a shape exclamationmark this is money

2dashes a large box of chocolate frogs from Hermione periodmark nextline nextline this only left one parcel periodmark Harry picked it up and felt it periodmark it was very light periodmark he unwrapped it periodmark nextline nextline something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds periodmark ron gasped periodmark nextline nextline i've heard of those commamark he said in a hushed voice commamark dropping the box of every flavor beans he'd gotten from Hermione periodmark if that's what i think it is 2dashes they're really rare commamark and really valuable periodmark nextline nextline what is it questionmark nextline nextline Harry picked the shining commamark silvery cloth off the floor periodmark it was strange to the touch commamark like water woven into material periodmark nextline nextline it's an invisibility cloak commamark said ron commamark a look of awe on his face periodmark i'm sure it is 2dashes try it on periodmark nextline nextline Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell periodmark nextline nextline it is exclamationmark look down exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry looked down at his feet commamark but they were gone periodmark he dashed to the mirror periodmark sure enough commamark his reflection looked back at him commamark just his head suspended in midair commamark his body completely invisible periodmark he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely periodmark nextline nextline there's a note exclamationmark said ron suddenly periodmark a note fell out of it exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter periodmark written in narrow commamark loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words

he said periodmark anything periodmark what's the matter questionmark nextline nextline nothing commamark said Harry periodmark he felt very strange periodmark who had sent the cloak questionmark had it really once belonged to his father questionmark before he could say or think anything else commamark the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and george Weasley bounded in periodmark Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight periodmark he didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet periodmark nextline nextline merry christmas exclamationmark nextline nextline hey commamark look 2dashes harry's got a Weasley sweater commamark too exclamationmark nextline nextline Fred and george were wearing blue sweaters commamark one with a large yellow f on it commamark the other a g

nextline i hate maroon commamark ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head periodmark nextline nextline you haven't got a letter on yours commamark george observed periodmark i suppose she thinks you don't forget your name periodmark but we're not stupid 2dashes we know we're called gred and forge periodmark nextline nextline what's all th is noise periodmark nextline nextline Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door commamark looking disapproving periodmark he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he commamark too commamark carried a lumpy sweater over his arm commamark which Fred seized periodmark nextline nextline p for prefect exclamationmark get it on commamark Percy commamark come on commamark we're all wearing ours commamark even Harry

semicolonmark mountains of roast and boiled potatoes semicolonmark platters of chipolatas semicolonmark tureens of buttered peas commamark silver boats of thick commamark rich gravy and cranberry sauce 2dashes and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table periodmark these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought commamark with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside periodmark Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang commamark it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke commamark while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live commamark white mice periodmark up at the high table commamark dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet commamark and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor flitwick had just read him periodmark nextline nextline flaming christmas puddings followed the

finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek commamark who commamark to harry's amazement commamark giggled and blushed commamark her top hat lopsided periodmark nextline nextline when Harry finally left the table commamark he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers commamark including a pack of nonexplodable commamark luminous balloons commamark a grow-your-own-warts

breath commamark they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room commamark where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron periodmark he suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much periodmark nextline nextline after a meal of turkey sandwiches commamark crumpets commamark trifle commamark and christmas cake commamark everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge periodmark nextline nextline it had been harry's best christmas day ever periodmark yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day periodmark not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it colonmark the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it periodmark nextline nextline ron commamark full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him commamark fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster periodmark Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it periodmark nextline nextline his father's periodmark periodmark periodmark this had been his father's periodmark he let the material flow over his hands commamark smoother than silk commamark light as air periodmark use it well commamark the note had said periodmark nextline nextline he had to try it commamark now periodmark he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself periodmark looking down at his legs commamark he saw only moonlight and shadows periodmark it was a very funny feeling periodmark nextline nextline use it well periodmark nextline nextline suddenly commamark Harry felt wide-awake periodmark the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak periodmark excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence periodmark he could go anywhere in this commamark anywhere commamark and Filch would never know periodmark nextline nextline ron grunted in his sleep periodmark should Harry wake him questionmark something held him back 2dashes his father's cloak 2dashes he felt that this time 2dashes the first time 2dashes he wanted to use it alone periodmark nextline nextline he crept out of the dormitory commamark down the stairs commamark across the common room commamark and climbed through the portrait hole periodmark nextline nextline who's there questionmark squawked the fat lady periodmark Harry said nothing periodmark he walked quickly down the corridor periodmark nextline nextline where should he go questionmark he stopped commamark his heart racing commamark and thought periodmark and then it came to him periodmark the restricted section in the library periodmark he'd be able to read as long as he liked commamark as long as it took to find out who flamel was periodmark nextline nextline he set off commamark drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked periodmark nextline nextline the library was pitch-black and very eerie periodmark Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books periodmark the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair commamark and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it commamark the sight gave him the creeps periodmark nextline nextline the restricted section was right at the back of the library periodmark step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library commamark he held up his lamp to read the titles periodmark nextline nextline they didn't tell him much periodmark their peeling commamark faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand periodmark some had no title at all periodmark nextline nextline one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood periodmark the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickled periodmark maybe he was imagining it commamark maybe not commamark but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books commamark as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be periodmark nextline nextline he had to start somewhere periodmark setting the lamp down carefully on the floor commamark he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book periodmark a large black and silver volume caught his eye periodmark he pulled it out with difficulty commamark because it was very heavy commamark and commamark balancing it on his knee commamark let it fall open periodmark nextline nextline a piercing commamark bloodcurdling shriek split the silence 2dashes the book was screaming exclamationmark Harry snapped it shut commamark but the shriek went on and on commamark one high commamark unbroken commamark earsplitting note periodmark he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp commamark which went out at once periodmark panicking commamark he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside 2dashes stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf commamark he ran for it periodmark he passed Filch in the doorway semicolonmark filch's pale commamark wild eyes looked straight through him commamark and Harry slipped under filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor commamark the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears periodmark nextline nextline he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor periodmark he had been so busy getting away from the library commamark he hadn't paid attention to where he was going periodmark perhaps because it was dark commamark he didn't recognize where he was at all periodmark there was a suit of armor near the kitchens commamark he knew commamark but he must be five floors above there periodmark nextline nextline you asked me to come directly to you commamark Professor commamark if anyone was wandering around at night commamark and somebody's been in the library restricted section periodmark nextline nextline Harry felt the blood drain out of his face periodmark wherever he was commamark Filch must know a shortcut commamark because his soft commamark greasy voice was getting nearer commamark and to his horror commamark it was snape who replied commamark the restricted section questionmark well commamark they can't be far commamark we'll catch them periodmark nextline nextline Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and snape came around the corner ahead periodmark they couldn't see him commamark of course commamark but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him 2dashes the cloak didn't stop him from being solid periodmark nextline nextline he backed away as quietly as he could periodmark a door stood ajar to his left periodmark it was his only hope periodmark he squeezed through it commamark holding his breath commamark trying not to move it commamark and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything periodmark they walked straight past commamark and Harry leaned against the wall commamark breathing deeply commamark listening to their footsteps dying away periodmark that had been close commamark very close periodmark it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in periodmark nextline nextline it looked like an unused classroom periodmark the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls commamark and there was an upturned wastepaper basket 2dashes but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there commamark something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way periodmark nextline nextline it was a magnificent mirror commamark as high as the ceiling commamark with an ornate gold frame commamark standing on two clawed feet periodmark there was an inscription carved around the top colonmark erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi periodmark his panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and snape commamark Harry moved nearer to the mirror commamark wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again periodmark he stepped in front of it periodmark nextline nextline he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming periodmark he whirled around periodmark his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed 2dashes for he had seen not only himself in the mirror commamark but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him periodmark nextline nextline but the room was empty periodmark breathing very fast commamark he turned slowly back to the mirror periodmark nextline nextline there he was commamark reflected in it commamark white and scared-looking commamark and there commamark reflected behind him commamark were at least ten others periodmark Harry looked over his shoulder 2dashes but still commamark no one was there periodmark or were they all invisible commamark too questionmark was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them commamark invisible or not questionmark he looked in the mirror again periodmark a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving periodmark he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him periodmark if she was really there commamark he'd touch her commamark their reflections were so close together commamark but he felt only air 2dashes she and the others existed only in the mirror periodmark nextline nextline she was a very pretty woman periodmark she had dark red hair and her eyes 2dashes her eyes are just like mine commamark Harry thought commamark edging a little closer to the glass periodmark bright green 2dashes exactly the same shape commamark but then he noticed that she was crying semicolonmark smiling commamark but crying at the same time periodmark the tall commamark thin commamark black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her periodmark he wore glasses commamark and his hair was very untidy periodmark it stuck up at the back commamark just as harry's did periodmark nextline nextline Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection periodmark nextline nextline mom questionmark he whispered periodmark dad questionmark nextline nextline they just looked at him commamark smiling periodmark and slowly commamark Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror commamark and saw other pairs of green eyes like his commamark other noses like his commamark even a little old man who looked as though he had harry's knobbly knees 2dashes Harry was looking at his family commamark for the first time in his life periodmark nextline nextline the potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them commamark his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them periodmark he had a powerful kind of ache inside him commamark half joy commamark half terrible sadness periodmark nextline nextline how long he stood there commamark he didn't know periodmark the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses periodmark he couldn't stay here commamark he had to find his way back to bed periodmark he tore his eyes away from his mother's face commamark whispered commamark i'll come back commamark nextline nextline and hurried from the room periodmark nextline nextline you could have woken me up commamark said ron commamark crossly periodmark nextline nextline you can come tonight commamark i'm going back commamark i want to show you the mirror periodmark nextline nextline i'd like to see your mom and dad commamark ron said eagerly periodmark nextline nextline and i want to see all your family commamark all the weasleys commamark you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone periodmark nextline nextline you can see them any old time commamark said ron periodmark just come round my house this summer periodmark anyway commamark maybe it only shows dead people periodmark shame about not finding flamel commamark though periodmark have some bacon or something commamark why aren't you eating anything questionmark nextline nextline Harry couldn't eat periodmark he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight periodmark he had almost forgotten about flamel periodmark it didn't seem very important anymore periodmark who cared what the three headed dog was guarding questionmark what did it matter if snape stole it commamark really questionmark are you all right questionmark said ron periodmark you look odd periodmark nextline nextline what Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again periodmark with ron covered in the cloak commamark too commamark they had to walk much more slowly the next night periodmark they tried retracing harry's route from the library commamark wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour periodmark nextline nextline i'm freezing commamark said ron periodmark let's forget it and go back periodmark nextline nextline no exclamationmark Harry hissed periodmark i know it's here somewhere periodmark nextline nextline they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction commamark but saw no one else periodmark just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold commamark Harry spotted the suit of armor periodmark nextline nextline it's here 2dashes just here 2dashes yes exclamationmark nextline nextline they pushed the door open periodmark Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror periodmark nextline nextline there they were periodmark his mother and father beamed at the sight of him periodmark nextline nextline see questionmark Harry whispered periodmark nextline nextline i can't see anything periodmark nextline nextline look exclamationmark look at them all periodmark periodmark periodmark there are loads of them periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline i can only see you periodmark nextline nextline look in it properly commamark go on commamark stand where i am periodmark nextline nextline Harry stepped aside commamark but with ron in front of the mirror commamark he couldn't see his family anymore commamark just ron in his paisley pajamas periodmark nextline nextline ron commamark though commamark was staring transfixed at his image periodmark nextline nextline look at me exclamationmark he said periodmark nextline nextline can you see all your family standing around you questionmark nextline nextline no 2dashes i'm alone 2dashes but i'm different 2dashes i look older 2dashes and i'm head boy exclamationmark nextline nextline what questionmark nextline nextline i am 2dashes i'm wearing the badge like bill used to 2dashes and i'm holding the house cup and the quidditch cup 2dashes i'm quidditch captain commamark too periodmark nextline nextline ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry periodmark nextline nextline do you think this mirror shows the future questionmark nextline nextline how can it questionmark all my family are dead 2dashes let me have another look 2dashes nextline nextline you had it to yourself all last night commamark give me a bit more time periodmark nextline nextline you're only holding the quidditch cup commamark what's interesting about that questionmark i want to see my parents periodmark nextline nextline don't push me 2dashes nextline nextline a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion periodmark nextline nextline they hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking periodmark nextline nextline quick exclamationmark nextline nextline ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs periodmark Norris came round the door periodmark ron and Harry stood quite still commamark both thinking the same thing 2dashes did the cloak work on cats questionmark after what seemed an age commamark she turned and left periodmark nextline nextline this isn't safe 2dashes she might have gone for Filch commamark i bet she heard us periodmark nextline nextline come on periodmark nextline nextline and ron pulled Harry out of the room periodmark nextline nextline the snow still hadn't melted the next morning periodmark nextline nextline want to play chess commamark Harry questionmark said ron periodmark nextline nextline no periodmark nextline nextline why don't we go down and visit Hagrid questionmark nextline nextline no periodmark periodmark periodmark you go periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline i know what you're thinking about commamark Harry commamark that mirror periodmark don't go back tonight periodmark nextline nextline why not questionmark nextline nextline i dunno commamark i've just got a bad feeling about it 2dashes and anyway commamark you've had too many close shaves already periodmark Filch commamark snape commamark and mrs periodmark Norris are wandering around periodmark so what if they can't see you questionmark what if they walk into you questionmark what if you knock something over questionmark nextline nextline you sound like Hermione periodmark nextline nextline i'm serious commamark Harry commamark don't go periodmark nextline nextline but Harry only had one thought in his head commamark which was to get back in front of the mirror commamark and ron wasn't going to stop him periodmark nextline nextline that third night he found his way more quickly than before periodmark he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise commamark but he didn't meet anyone periodmark nextline nextline and there were his mother and father smiling at him again commamark and one of his grandfathers nodding happily periodmark Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror periodmark there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family periodmark nothing at all periodmark nextline nextline except 2dashes so 2dashes back again commamark Harry questionmark nextline nextline Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice periodmark he looked behind him periodmark sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore periodmark Harry must have walked straight past him commamark so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him periodmark nextline nextline 2dashes i didn't see you commamark sir periodmark nextline nextline strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you commamark said dumbledore commamark and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling periodmark nextline nextline so commamark said dumbledore commamark slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry commamark you commamark like hundreds before you commamark have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised periodmark nextline nextline i didn't know it was called that commamark sir periodmark nextline nextline but i expect you've realized by now what it does questionmark nextline nextline it 2dashes well 2dashes it shows me my family 2dashes nextline nextline and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy periodmark nextline nextline how did you know 2dashes questionmark nextline nextline i don't need a cloak to become invisible commamark said dumbledore gently periodmark nextline nextline now commamark can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all questionmark nextline nextline Harry shook his head periodmark nextline nextline let me explain periodmark the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror commamark that is commamark he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is periodmark does that help questionmark nextline nextline Harry thought periodmark then he said slowly commamark it shows us what we want periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline whatever we want periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline yes and no commamark said dumbledore quietly periodmark it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest commamark most desperate desire of our hearts periodmark you commamark who have never known your family commamark see them standing around you periodmark Ronald Weasley commamark who has always been overshadowed by his brothers commamark sees himself standing alone commamark the best of all of them periodmark however commamark this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth periodmark men have wasted away before it commamark entranced by what they have seen commamark or been driven mad commamark not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible periodmark nextline nextline the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow commamark Harry commamark and i ask you not to go looking for it again periodmark if you ever do run across it commamark you will now be prepared periodmark it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live commamark remember that periodmark now commamark why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed questionmark nextline nextline Harry stood up periodmark nextline nextline sir 2dashes Professor dumbledore questionmark can i ask you something questionmark nextline nextline obviously commamark you've just done so commamark dumbledore smiled periodmark you may ask me one more thing commamark however periodmark nextline nextline what do you see when you look in the mirror questionmark nextline nextline i questionmark i see myself holding a pair of thick commamark woolen socks periodmark nextline nextline Harry stared periodmark nextline nextline one can never have enough socks commamark said dumbledore periodmark another christmas has come and gone and i didn't get a single pair periodmark people will insist on giving me books periodmark nextline nextline it was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful periodmark but then commamark he thought commamark as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow commamark it had been quite a personal question periodmark nextline nextline chapter thirteen nextline nextline nicolas flamel nextline nextline dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again commamark and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk periodmark Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily commamark but he couldn't periodmark he started having nightmares periodmark over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light commamark while a high voice cackled with laughter periodmark nextline nextline you see commamark dumbledore was right commamark that mirror could drive you mad commamark said ron commamark when Harry told him about these drearns periodmark nextline nextline Hermione commamark who came back the day before term started commamark took a different view of things periodmark she was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed commamark roaming the school three nights in a row (if Filch had caught you exclamationmark) commamark and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who nicolas flamel was periodmark nextline nextline they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li- brary book commamark even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere periodmark nextline nextline once term had started commamark they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks periodmark Harry had even less time than the other two commamark because quidditch practice had started again periodmark nextline nextline wood was working the team harder than ever periodmark even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits periodmark the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic commamark but Harry was on wood's side periodmark if they won their next match commamark against hufflepuff commamark they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years periodmark quite apart from wanting to win commamark Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training periodmark nextline nextline then commamark during one particularly wet and muddy practice session commamark wood gave the team a bit of bad news periodmark he'd just gotten very angry with the weasleys commamark who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms periodmark nextline nextline will you stop messing around exclamationmark he yelled periodmark that's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match exclamationmark snape's refereeing this time commamark and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor exclamationmark nextline nextline george Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words periodmark nextline nextline snape's refereeing questionmark he spluttered through a mouthful of mud periodmark when's he ever refereed a quidditch match questionmark he's not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin periodmark nextline nextline the rest of the team landed next to george to complain commamark too periodmark nextline nextline it's not my fault commamark said wood periodmark we've just got to make sure we play a clean game commamark so snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us periodmark nextline nextline which was all very well commamark thought Harry commamark but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice commamark but Harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room commamark where he found ron and Hermione playing chess periodmark chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at commamark something Harry and ron thought was very good for her periodmark nextline nextline don't talk to me for a moment commamark said ron when Harry sat down next to him commamark i need to concen 2dashes he caught sight of harry's face periodmark what's the matter with you questionmark you look terrible periodmark nextline nextline speaking quietly so that no one else would hear commamark Harry told the other two about snape's sudden commamark sinister desire to be a quidditch referee periodmark nextline nextline don't play commamark said Hermione at once periodmark nextline nextline say you're ill commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline pretend to break your leg commamark Hermione suggested periodmark nextline nextline really break your leg commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline i can't commamark said Harry periodmark there isn't a reserve seeker periodmark if i back out commamark gryffindor can't play at all periodmark nextline nextline at that moment neville toppled into the common room periodmark how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess commamark because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg-locker curse periodmark he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower periodmark nextline nextline everyone fell over laughing except Hermione commamark who leapt up and performed the countercurse periodmark neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet commamark trembling periodmark what happened questionmark Hermione asked him commamark leading him over to sit with Harry and ron periodmark nextline nextline Malfoy commamark said neville shakily periodmark i met him outside the library periodmark he said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on periodmark nextline nextline go to Professor McGonagall exclamationmark Hermione urged neville periodmark report him exclamationmark nextline nextline neville shook his head periodmark nextline nextline i don't want more trouble commamark he mumbled periodmark nextline nextline you've got to stand up to him commamark neville exclamationmark said ron periodmark he's used to walking all over people commamark but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier periodmark nextline nextline there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in gryffindor commamark malfoy's already done that commamark neville choked out periodmark nextline nextline Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog commamark the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for christmas periodmark he gave it to neville commamark who looked as though he might cry periodmark nextline nextline you're worth twelve of Malfoy commamark Harry said periodmark the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor commamark didn't it questionmark and where's Malfoy questionmark in stinking slytherin periodmark nextline nextline neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog periodmark nextline nextline thanks commamark Harry periodmark periodmark periodmark i think i'll go to bed periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark d'you want the card commamark you collect them commamark don't you questionmark nextline nextline as neville walked away commamark Harry looked at the famous wizard card periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore again commamark he said commamark he was the first one i ever- nextline nextline he gasped periodmark he stared at the back of the card periodmark then he

periodmark Hermione ignored him periodmark nextline nextline nicolas flamel commamark she whispered dramatically commamark is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone exclamationmark nextline nextline this didn't have quite the effect she'd expected periodmark nextline nextline the what questionmark said Harry and ron periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark honestly commamark don't you

just as long as we're not wiping you off the field commamark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline as the match drew nearer commamark however commamark Harry became more and more nervous commamark whatever he told ron and Hermione periodmark the rest of the team wasn't too calm commamark either periodmark the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful commamark no one had done it for seven years commamark but would they be allowed to commamark with such a biased referee questionmark Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not commamark but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went periodmark at times commamark he even wondered whether snape was following him commamark trying to catch him on his own periodmark potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture commamark snape was so horrible to Harry periodmark could snape possibly know they'd found out about the sorcerer's stone questionmark Harry didn't see how

neville commamark who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried commamark or why they had both brought their wands to the match periodmark little did Harry know that ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the leg-locker curse periodmark they'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on neville commamark and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry periodmark nextline nextline now commamark don't forget commamark it's locomotor mortis commamark Hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve periodmark nextline nextline i know commamark ron snapped periodmark don't nag periodmark nextline nextline back in the locker room commamark wood had taken Harry aside periodmark nextline nextline don't want to pressure you commamark Potter commamark but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now periodmark finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much periodmark nextline nextline the whole school's out

silver beard periodmark nextline nextline Harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe periodmark there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching periodmark nextline nextline perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field commamark something that ron noticed commamark too periodmark nextline nextline i've never seen snape look so mean commamark he told Hermione periodmark look -they're off ouch exclamationmark nextline nextline someone had poked ron in the back of the head periodmark it

periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle periodmark clearly not wanting to be seen commamark it walked as fast as possible

at a run periodmark he followed periodmark nextline nextline the trees were so thick he couldn't see where snape had gone periodmark he flew in circles commamark lower and lower commamark brushing the

commamark holding tight to his broomstick commamark trying to see through the leaves periodmark below commamark in a shadowy clearing commamark stood snape commamark but he wasn't alone periodmark quirrell was there commamark too periodmark nextline nextline Harry couldn't make out the look on his face commamark but he was stuttering worse than ever periodmark Harry strained to catch what they

2dashes nextline nextline very well commamark snape cut in periodmark we'll have another little chat soon commamark when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie periodmark nextline nextline he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing periodmark it was almost dark now commamark but Harry could see quirrell commamark standing quite still as

periodmark nextline nextline so we were right commamark it is the sorcerer's stone commamark and snape's trying to force quirrell to help him get it periodmark he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy - and he said something about quirrell's 'hocus pocuss 2dashes i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy commamark loads of enchantments commamark probably commamark and quirrell would have done some anti-dark arts spell that snape needs to break through 2dashes nextline nextline so you mean the stone's only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape questionmark said Hermione in alarm periodmark nextline nextline it'll be gone by next tuesday commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline chapter fourteen nextline nextline norbert the norwegian ridgeback nextline nextline quirrell commamark however commamark must have been braver than they'd thought periodmark in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner commamark but it

door to check that fluffy was still growling inside periodmark snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper commamark which surely meant that the stone was still safe periodmark whenever Harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile commamark and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell's stutter periodmark nextline nextline Hermione commamark however commamark had more on her mind than the sorcerer's stone periodmark she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes periodmark nextline nextline Harry and ron wouldn't

nextline nearly there exclamationmark Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower periodmark nextline nextline then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the

all those points commamark him and a couple of other stupid first years periodmark nextline nextline from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school commamark Harry was suddenly

commamark thanks Potter commamark we owe you one exclamationmark nextline nextline only ron stood by him periodmark nextline nextline they'll all forget this in a few weeks periodmark Fred and george

Harry told them what he'd heard periodmark nextline nextline snape's done it commamark then exclamationmark said ron periodmark if quirrell's told him how to break his anti-dark force spell 2dashes nextline nextline there's still fluffy commamark though commamark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline maybe snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid commamark nextline nextline said ron commamark looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them periodmark i bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog periodmark so what do we do commamark Harry questionmark nextline nextline the light of adventure was kindling again in ron's eyes commamark but Hermione answered before Harry could periodmark nextline nextline go to dumbledore periodmark that's what we should have done ages ago periodmark if we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure periodmark nextline nextline but we've got no proof

commamark we're not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy periodmark that'll take a lot of explaining periodmark nextline nextline Hermione looked convinced commamark but ron didn't periodmark nextline nextline if we just do a bit of poking around 2dashes nextline nextline no commamark said Harry flatly commamark we've done enough poking around periodmark nextline nextline he pulled a map

was a centaur we heard earlier questionmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline did that sound like hooves to you questionmark nah commamark if yeh ask me commamark that was what's bin killin' the unicorns 2dashes never heard anythin' like it before periodmark nextline nextline they walked on through the dense commamark dark trees periodmark Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder periodmark he had the nasty feeling they were being watched periodmark he was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them periodmark nextline nextline they had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed hagrid's arm periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid exclamationmark look exclamationmark red sparks commamark the others are in trouble exclamationmark nextline nextline you two wait here exclamationmark Hagrid shouted periodmark stay on the path commamark i'll come back for yeh exclamationmark nextline nextline they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other commamark very scared commamark until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them periodmark nextline nextline you don't think they've been hurt commamark do you questionmark whispered Hermione periodmark nextline nextline i don't care if Malfoy has commamark but if something's got neville periodmark periodmark periodmark it's our fault he's here in the first place periodmark nextline nextline the minutes dragged by periodmark their ears seemed sharper than usual periodmark harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind commamark every cracking twig periodmark nextline nextline what was going on questionmark where were the others questionmark at last commamark a great crunching noise announced hagrid's return periodmark Malfoy commamark neville commamark and fang were with him periodmark Hagrid was fuming periodmark Malfoy commamark it seemed commamark had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke periodmark neville had panicked and sent up the sparks periodmark nextline nextline we'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now commamark with the racket you two were makin' periodmark right commamark we're changin' groups 2dashes neville commamark you stay with me an' Hermione commamark Harry commamark you go with fang an' this idiot periodmark i'm sorry commamark Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry commamark but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you commamark an' we've gotta get this done periodmark nextline nextline so Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and fang periodmark they walked for nearly half an hour commamark deeper and deeper into the forest commamark until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick periodmark Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker periodmark there were splashes on the roots of a tree commamark as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by periodmark Harry could see a clearing ahead commamark through the tangled branches of an ancient oak periodmark nextline nextline look 2dashes he murmured commamark holding out his arm to stop Malfoy periodmark nextline nextline something bright white was gleaming on the ground periodmark they inched closer periodmark nextline nextline it was the unicorn all right commamark and it was dead periodmark Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad periodmark its long commamark slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves periodmark nextline nextline Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood periodmark a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline then commamark out of the shadows commamark a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast periodmark Harry commamark Malfoy commamark and fang stood transfixed periodmark the cloaked figure reached the unicorn commamark lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side commamark and began to drink its blood periodmark nextline nextline aaaaaaaaaargh exclamationmark nextline nextline Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted 2dashes so did fang periodmark the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry 2dashes unicorn blood was dribbling down its front periodmark it got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry 2dashes he couldn't move for fear periodmark nextline nextline then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head semicolonmark it was as though his scar were on fire periodmark half blinded commamark he staggered backward periodmark he heard hooves behind him commamark galloping commamark and something jumped clean over Harry commamark charging at the figure periodmark nextline nextline the pain in harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees periodmark it took a minute or two to pass periodmark when he looked up commamark the figure had gone periodmark a centaur was standing over him commamark not ronan or bane semicolonmark this one looked younger semicolonmark he had white-blond hair and a palomino body periodmark nextline nextline are you all right questionmark said the centaur commamark pulling Harry to his feet periodmark nextline nextline yes 2dashes thank you 2dashes what was that questionmark nextline nextline the centaur didn't answer periodmark he had astonishingly blue eyes commamark like pale sapphires periodmark he looked carefully at Harry commamark his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out commamark livid commamark on harry's forehead periodmark nextline nextline you are the Potter boy commamark he said periodmark you had better get back to Hagrid periodmark nextline nextline the forest is not safe at this time 2dashes especially for you periodmark can you ride questionmark it will be quicker this way periodmark nextline nextline my name is firenze commamark he added commamark as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back periodmark nextline nextline there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing periodmark ronan and bane came bursting through the trees commamark their flanks heaving and sweaty periodmark nextline nextline firenze exclamationmark bane thundered periodmark what are you doing questionmark you have a human on your back exclamationmark have you no shame questionmark are you a common mule questionmark nextline nextline do you realize who this is questionmark said firenze periodmark this is the Potter boy periodmark the quicker he leaves this forest commamark the better periodmark nextline nextline what have you been telling him questionmark growled bane periodmark remember commamark firenze commamark we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens periodmark have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets questionmark nextline nextline ronan pawed the ground nervously periodmark i'm sure firenze thought he was acting for the best commamark he said in his gloomy voice periodmark nextline nextline bane kicked his back legs in anger periodmark nextline nextline for the best exclamationmark what is that to do with us questionmark centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold exclamationmark it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest exclamationmark nextline nextline firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger commamark so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on periodmark nextline nextline do you not see that unicorn questionmark firenze bellowed at bane periodmark do you not understand why it was killed questionmark or have the planets not let you in on that secret questionmark i set myself against what is lurking in this forest commamark bane commamark yes commamark with humans alongside me if i must periodmark nextline nextline and firenze whisked around semicolonmark with Harry clutching on as best he could commamark they plunged off into the trees commamark leaving ronan and bane behind them periodmark nextline nextline Harry didn't have a clue what was going on periodmark nextline nextline why's bane so angry questionmark he asked periodmark what was that thing you saved me from commamark anyway questionmark nextline nextline firenze slowed to a walk commamark warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches commamark but did not answer harry's question periodmark they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore periodmark they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees commamark however commamark when firenze suddenly stopped periodmark nextline nextline Harry Potter commamark do you know what unicorn blood is used -for questionmark nextline nextline no commamark said Harry commamark startled by the odd question periodmark we've only used the horn and tail hair in potions periodmark nextline nextline that is because it is a monstrous thing commamark to slay a unicorn commamark said firenze periodmark only one who has nothing to lose commamark and everything to gain commamark would commit such a crime periodmark the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive commamark even if you are an inch from death commamark but at a terrible price periodmark you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself commamark and you will have but a half-life commamark a cursed life commamark from the moment the blood touches your lips periodmark nextline nextline Harry stared at the back of firenze's head commamark which was dappled silver in the moonlight periodmark nextline nextline but who'd be that desperate questionmark he wondered aloud periodmark if you're going to be cursed forever commamark deaths better commamark isn't it questionmark nextline nextline it is commamark firenze agreed commamark unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else 2dashes something that will bring you back to full strength and power 2dashes something that will mean you can never die periodmark nextline nextline mr periodmark Potter commamark do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment questionmark nextline nextline the sorcerer's stone exclamationmark of course 2dashes the elixir of life exclamationmark but i don't understand who 2dashes nextline nextline can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power commamark who has clung to life commamark awaiting their chance questionmark nextline nextline it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry's heart periodmark over the rustling of the trees commamark he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met colonmark some say he died periodmark nextline nextline codswallop commamark in my opinion periodmark dunno if he had enough human left in him to die periodmark nextline nextline do you mean commamark Harry croaked commamark that was vol- nextline nextline Harry exclamationmark Harry commamark are you all right questionmark nextline nextline Hermione was running toward them down the path commamark Hagrid puffing along behind her periodmark nextline nextline i'm fine commamark said Harry commamark hardly knowing what he was saying periodmark the unicorn's dead commamark Hagrid commamark it's in that clearing back there periodmark nextline nextline this is where i leave you commamark firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn periodmark you are safe now periodmark nextline nextline Harry slid off his back periodmark nextline nextline good luck commamark Harry Potter commamark said firenze periodmark the planets have been read wrongly before now commamark even by centaurs periodmark i hope this is one of those times periodmark nextline nextline he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest commamark leaving Harry shivering behind him periodmark nextline nextline ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room commamark waiting for them to return periodmark he shouted something about quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake periodmark in a matter of seconds commamark though commamark he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest periodmark nextline nextline Harry couldn't sit down periodmark he paced up and down in front of the fire periodmark he was still shaking periodmark nextline nextline snape wants the stone for Voldemort periodmark periodmark periodmark and voldemort's waiting in the forest periodmark periodmark periodmark and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline stop saying the name exclamationmark said ron in a terrified whisper commamark as if he thought Voldemort could hear them periodmark nextline nextline Harry wasn't listening periodmark nextline nextline firenze saved me commamark but he shouldn't have done so periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark bane was furious periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark they must show that voldemort's coming back periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark bane thinks firenze should have let Voldemort kill me periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark i suppose that's written in the stars as well periodmark nextline nextline will you stop saying the name exclamationmark ron hissed periodmark nextline nextline so all i've got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone commamark Harry went on feverishly commamark then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off periodmark periodmark periodmark well commamark i suppose bane'll be happy periodmark nextline nextline Hermione looked very frightened commamark but she had a word of comfort periodmark nextline nextline Harry commamark everyone says dumbledore's the only one you-know-who was ever afraid of with dumbledore around commamark you-know-who won't touch you periodmark anyway commamark who says the centaurs are right questionmark it sounds like fortune-telling to me commamark and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic periodmark nextline nextline the sky had turned light before they stopped talking periodmark they went to bed exhausted commamark their throats sore periodmark but the night's surprises weren't over periodmark nextline nextline when Harry pulled back his sheets commamark he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them periodmark there was a note pinned to it colonmark just in case periodmark nextline nextline chapter sixteen nextline nextline through the trapdoor nextline nextline in years to come commamark Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment periodmark yet the days crept by commamark and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door periodmark nextline nextline it was sweltering hot commamark especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers periodmark they had been given special commamark new quills for the exams commamark which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell periodmark nextline nextline they had practical exams as well periodmark Professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk periodmark Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox 2dashes points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was commamark but taken away if it had whiskers periodmark snape made them all nervous commamark breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion periodmark nextline nextline Harry did the best he could commamark trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead commamark which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest periodmark neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep commamark but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare commamark except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it periodmark nextline nextline maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest commamark or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads commamark but ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the stone as Harry periodmark the idea of Voldemort certainly scared them commamark but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams commamark and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to periodmark nextline nextline their very last exam was history of magic periodmark one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free commamark free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out periodmark when the ghost of Professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment commamark Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest periodmark nextline nextline that was far easier than i thought it would be commamark said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds periodmark i needn't have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager periodmark nextline nextline Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward commamark but ron said this made him feel ill commamark so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree periodmark the Weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid commamark which was basking in the warm shallows periodmark no more studying commamark ron sighed happily commamark stretching out on the grass periodmark you could look more cheerful commamark Harry commamark we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done commamark there's no need to worry yet periodmark nextline nextline Harry was rubbing his forehead periodmark nextline nextline i wish i knew what this means exclamationmark he burst out angrily periodmark my scar keeps hurting 2dashes it's happened before commamark but never as often as this periodmark nextline nextline go to madam pomfrey commamark Hermione suggested periodmark nextline nextline i'm not ill commamark said Harry periodmark i think it's a warning periodmark periodmark periodmark it means danger's coming periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline ron couldn't get worked up commamark it was too hot periodmark nextline nextline Harry commamark relax commamark hermione's right commamark the stone's safe as long as dumbledore's around periodmark anyway commamark we've never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy periodmark he nearly had his leg ripped off once commamark he's not going to try it again in a hurry periodmark and neville will play quidditch for england before Hagrid lets dumbledore down periodmark nextline nextline Harry nodded commamark but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do commamark something important periodmark when he tried to explain this commamark Hermione said commamark that's just the exams periodmark i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we'd done that one periodmark nextline nextline Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work commamark though periodmark he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky commamark a note clamped in its mouth periodmark Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters periodmark Hagrid would never betray dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy periodmark periodmark periodmark never periodmark periodmark periodmark but 2dashes Harry suddenly jumped to his feet periodmark nextline nextline where're you going questionmark said ron sleepily periodmark nextline nextline i've just thought of something commamark said Harry periodmark he had turned white periodmark nextline nextline we've got to go and see Hagrid commamark now periodmark nextline nextline why questionmark panted Hermione commamark hurrying to keep up periodmark nextline nextline don't you think it's a bit odd commamark said Harry commamark scrambling up the grassy slope commamark that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon commamark and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket questionmark how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law questionmark lucky they found Hagrid commamark don't you think questionmark why didn't i see it before questionmark nextline nextline what are you talking about questionmark said ron commamark but Harry commamark sprinting across the grounds toward the forest commamark didn't answer periodmark nextline nextline Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house semicolonmark his trousers and sleeves were rolled up commamark and he was shelling peas into a large bowl periodmark nextline nextline hullo commamark he said commamark smiling periodmark finished yer exams questionmark got time fer a drink questionmark nextline nextline yes commamark please commamark said ron commamark but Harry cut him off periodmark nextline nextline no commamark we're in a hurry periodmark Hagrid commamark i've got to ask you something periodmark you know that night you won norbert questionmark what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like questionmark nextline nextline dunno commamark said Hagrid casually commamark he wouldn' take his cloak off periodmark nextline nextline he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows periodmark nextline nextline it's not that unusual commamark yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the hog's head 2dashes that's the pub down in the village periodmark mighta bin a dragon dealer commamark mightn' he questionmark i never saw his face commamark he kept his hood up periodmark nextline nextline Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas periodmark what did you talk to him about commamark Hagrid questionmark did you mention hogwarts at all questionmark nextline nextline mighta come up commamark said Hagrid commamark frowning as he tried to remember periodmark nextline nextline yeah periodmark periodmark periodmark he asked what i did commamark an' i told him i was gamekeeper here periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after periodmark periodmark periodmark so i told him periodmark periodmark periodmark an' i said what i'd always really wanted was a dragon periodmark periodmark periodmark an' then periodmark periodmark periodmark i can' remember too well commamark 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline let's see periodmark periodmark periodmark yeah commamark then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if i wanted periodmark periodmark periodmark but he had ter be sure i could handle it commamark he didn' want it ter go ter any old home periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark so i told him commamark after fluffy commamark a dragon would be easy periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline and did he 2dashes did he seem interested in fluffy questionmark Harry asked commamark try ing to keep his voice calm periodmark nextline nextline well 2dashes yeah 2dashes how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet commamark even around hogwarts questionmark so i told him commamark fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down commamark jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep 2dashes nextline nextline Hagrid suddenly looked horrified periodmark nextline nextline i shouldn'ta told yeh that exclamationmark he blurted out periodmark forget i said it exclamationmark hey 2dashes where're yeh goin' questionmark nextline nextline Harry commamark ron commamark and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall commamark which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds periodmark nextline nextline we've got to go to dumbledore commamark said Harry periodmark Hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy commamark and it was either snape or Voldemort under that cloak 2dashes it must've been easy commamark once he'd got Hagrid drunk periodmark i just hope dumbledore believes us periodmark firenze might back us up if bane doesn't stop him periodmark where's dumbledore's office questionmark nextline nextline they looked around commamark as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction periodmark they had never been told where dumbledore lived commamark nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him periodmark nextline nextline we'll just have to 2dashes Harry began commamark but a voice suddenly rang across the hall periodmark nextline nextline what are you three doing inside questionmark nextline nextline it was Professor McGonagall commamark carrying a large pile of books periodmark nextline nextline we want to see Professor dumbledore commamark said Hermione commamark rather bravely commamark Harry and ron thought periodmark nextline nextline see Professor dumbledore questionmark Professor McGonagall repeated commamark as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do periodmark why questionmark nextline nextline Harry swallowed 2dashes now what questionmark it's sort of secret commamark he said commamark but he wished at once he hadn't commamark because Professor mcgonagall's nostrils flared periodmark nextline nextline Professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago commamark she said coldly periodmark he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once periodmark nextline nextline he's gone questionmark said Harry frantically periodmark now questionmark nextline nextline Professor dumbledore is a very great wizard commamark Potter commamark he has many demands on his time 2dashes but this is important periodmark nextline nextline something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic commamark Potter periodmark nextline nextline look commamark said Harry commamark throwing caution to the winds commamark Professor 2dashes it's about the sorcerer's tone 2dashes nextline nextline whatever Professor McGonagall had expected commamark it wasn't that periodmark the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms commamark but she didn't pick them up periodmark nextline nextline how do you know 2dashes questionmark she spluttered periodmark nextline nextline Professor commamark i think 2dashes i know 2dashes that sn- that someone's going to try and steal the stone periodmark i've got to talk to Professor dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion periodmark nextline nextline Professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow commamark she said finally periodmark i don't know how you found out about the stone commamark but rest assured commamark no one can possibly steal it commamark it's too well protected periodmark nextline nextline but Professor 2dashes nextline nextline Potter commamark i know what i'm talking about commamark she said shortly periodmark she bent down and gathered up the fallen books periodmark i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine periodmark nextline nextline but they didn't periodmark nextline nextline it's tonight commamark said Harry commamark once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot periodmark snape's going through the trapdoor tonight periodmark he's found out everything he needs commamark and now he's got dumbledore out of the way periodmark he sent that note commamark i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up periodmark nextline nextline but what can we 2dashes nextline nextline Hermione gasped periodmark Harry and ron wheeled round periodmark nextline nextline snape was standing there periodmark nextline nextline good afternoon commamark he said smoothly periodmark nextline nextline they stared at him periodmark nextline nextline you shouldn't be inside on a day like this commamark he said commamark with an odd commamark twisted smile periodmark nextline nextline we were 2dashes Harry began commamark without any idea what he was going to say periodmark nextline nextline you want to be more careful commamark said snape periodmark hanging around like this commamark people will think you're up to something periodmark and gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points commamark can it questionmark nextline nextline Harry flushed periodmark they turned to go outside commamark but snape called them back periodmark nextline nextline be warned commamark Potter 2dashes any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled periodmark good day to you periodmark nextline nextline he strode off in the direction of the staffroom periodmark nextline nextline out on the stone steps commamark Harry turned to the others periodmark nextline nextline right commamark here's what we've got to do commamark he whispered urgently periodmark one of us has got to keep an eye on snape 2dashes wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it periodmark Hermione commamark you'd better do that periodmark nextline nextline why me questionmark nextline nextline it's obvious commamark said ron periodmark you can pretend to be waiting for Professor flitwick commamark you know periodmark he put on a high voice commamark 'oh Professor flitwick commamark i'm so worried commamark i think i got question fourteen b wrong periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark'“ nextline nextline oh commamark shut up commamark said Hermione commamark but she agreed to go and watch out for snape periodmark nextline nextline and we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor commamark Harry told ron periodmark nextline nextline come on periodmark nextline nextline but that part of the plan didn't work periodmark no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time commamark she lost her temper periodmark nextline nextline i suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments exclamationmark she stormed periodmark enough of this nonsense exclamationmark if i hear you 've come anywhere near here again commamark i'll take another fifty points from gryffindor exclamationmark yes commamark Weasley commamark from my own house exclamationmark Harry and ron went back to the common room commamark Harry had just said commamark at least hermione's on snape's tail commamark when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and Hermione came in periodmark nextline nextline i'm sorry commamark Harry exclamationmark she wailed periodmark snape came out and asked me what i was doing commamark so i said i was waiting for flitwick commamark and snape went to get him commamark and i've only just got away commamark i don't know where snape went periodmark nextline nextline well commamark that's it then commamark isn't it questionmark Harry said periodmark nextline nextline the other two stared at him periodmark he was pale and his eyes were glittering periodmark nextline nextline i'm going out of here tonight and i'm going to try and get to the stone first periodmark nextline nextline you're mad exclamationmark said ron periodmark nextline nextline you can't exclamationmark said Hermione periodmark after what McGonagall and snape have said questionmark you'll be expelled exclamationmark nextline nextline so whap Harry shouted periodmark don't you understand questionmark if snape gets hold of the stone commamark voldemort's coming back exclamationmark haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over questionmark there won't be any hogwarts to get expelled from exclamationmark he'll flatten it commamark or turn it into a school for the dark arts exclamationmark losing points doesn't matter anymore commamark can't you see questionmark d'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup questionmark if i get caught before i can get to the stone commamark well commamark i'll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there commamark it's only dying a bit later than i would have commamark because i'm never going over to the dark side exclamationmark i'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me exclamationmark Voldemort killed my parents commamark remember questionmark nextline nextline he glared at them periodmark nextline nextline you're right Harry commamark said Hermione in a small voice periodmark nextline nextline i'll use the invisibility cloak commamark said Harry periodmark it's just lucky i got it back periodmark nextline nextline but will it cover all three of us questionmark said ron periodmark nextline nextline all 2dashes all three of us questionmark nextline nextline oh commamark come off it commamark you don't think we'd let you go alone questionmark nextline nextline of course not commamark said Hermione briskly periodmark how do you think you'd get to the stone without us questionmark i'd better go and took through my books commamark there might be something useful periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline but if we get caught commamark you two will be expelled commamark too periodmark nextline nextline not if i can help it commamark said Hermione grimly periodmark flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam periodmark they're not throwing me out after that periodmark nextline nextline after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room periodmark nextline nextline nobody bothered them semicolonmark none of the gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more commamark after all periodmark this was the first night he hadn't been upset by it periodmark Hermione was skimming through all her notes commamark hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break periodmark Harry and ron didn't talk much periodmark both of them were thinking about what they were about to do periodmark nextline nextline slowly commamark the room emptied as people drifted off to bed periodmark nextline nextline better get the cloak commamark ron muttered commamark as lee jordan finally left commamark stretching and yawning periodmark Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory periodmark he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for christmas periodmark he pocketed it to use on fluffy 2dashes he didn't feel much like singing periodmark nextline nextline he ran back down to the common room periodmark nextline nextline we'd better put the cloak on here commamark and make sure it covers all three of us 2dashes if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own 2dashes nextline nextline what are you doing questionmark said a voice from the corner of the room periodmark neville appeared from behind an armchair commamark clutching trevor the toad commamark who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom periodmark nextline nextline nothing commamark neville commamark nothing commamark said Harry commamark hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back periodmark nextline nextline neville stared at their guilty faces periodmark nextline nextline you're going out again commamark he said periodmark nextline nextline no commamark no commamark no commamark said Hermione periodmark no commamark we're not periodmark why don't you go to bed commamark neville questionmark nextline nextline Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door periodmark they couldn't afford to waste any more time commamark snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep periodmark nextline nextline you can't go out commamark said neville commamark you'll be caught again periodmark gryffindor will be in even more trouble periodmark nextline nextline you don't understand commamark said Harry commamark this is important periodmark nextline nextline but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate periodmark nextline nextline i won't let you do it commamark he said commamark hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole periodmark i'll 2dashes i'll fight you exclamationmark nextline nextline neville commamark ron exploded commamark get away from that hole and don't be an idiot 2dashes nextline nextline don't you call me an idiot exclamationmark said neville periodmark i don't think you should be breaking any more rules exclamationmark and you were the one who told me to stand up to people exclamationmark nextline nextline yes commamark but not to us commamark said ron in exasperation periodmark neville commamark you don't know what you're doing periodmark nextline nextline he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad commamark who leapt out of sight periodmark nextline nextline go on then commamark try and hit me exclamationmark said neville commamark raising his fists periodmark i'm ready exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry turned to Hermione periodmark nextline nextline do something commamark he said desperately periodmark nextline nextline Hermione stepped forward periodmark nextline nextline neville commamark she said commamark i'm really commamark really sorry about this periodmark nextline nextline she raised her wand periodmark nextline nextline petrificus totalus exclamationmark she cried commamark pointing it at neville periodmark nextline nextline neville's arms snapped to his sides periodmark his legs sprang together periodmark his whole body rigid commamark he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face commamark stiff as a board periodmark nextline nextline Hermione ran to turn him over periodmark neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak periodmark only his eyes were moving commamark looking at them in horror periodmark nextline nextline what've you done to him questionmark Harry whispered periodmark nextline nextline it's the full body-bind commamark said Hermione miserably periodmark oh commamark neville commamark i'm so sorry periodmark nextline nextline we had to commamark neville commamark no time to explain commamark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline you'll understand later commamark neville commamark said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak periodmark nextline nextline but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen periodmark in their nervous state commamark every statue's shadow looked like Filch commamark every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them periodmark at the foot of the first set of stairs commamark they spotted mrs periodmark Norris skulking near the top periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark let's kick her commamark just this once commamark ron whispered in harry's ear commamark but Harry shook his head periodmark as they climbed carefully around her commamark mrs periodmark Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them commamark but didn't do anything periodmark nextline nextline they didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor periodmark peeves was bobbing halfway up commamark loosening the carpet so that people would trip periodmark nextline nextline who's there questionmark he said suddenly as they climbed toward him periodmark he narrowed his wicked black eyes periodmark know you're there commamark even if i can't see you periodmark are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie questionmark nextline nextline he rose up in the air and floated there commamark squinting at them periodmark nextline nextline should call Filch commamark i should commamark if something's a-creeping around unseen periodmark nextline nextline Harry had a sudden idea periodmark nextline nextline peeves commamark he said commamark in a hoarse whisper commamark the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible periodmark nextline nextline peeves almost fell out of the air in shock periodmark he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs periodmark nextline nextline so sorry commamark your bloodiness commamark mr periodmark baron commamark sir commamark he said greasily periodmark my mistake commamark my mistake 2dashes i didn't see you 2dashes of course i didn't commamark you're invisible 2dashes forgive old peevsie his little joke commamark sir periodmark nextline nextline i have business here commamark peeves commamark croaked Harry periodmark stay away from this place tonight periodmark nextline nextline i will commamark sir commamark i most certainly will commamark said peeves commamark rising up in the air again periodmark hope your business goes well commamark baron commamark i'll not bother you periodmark nextline nextline and he scooted off brilliant commamark Harry exclamationmark whispered ron periodmark nextline nextline a few seconds later commamark they were there commamark outside the third-floor corridor 2dashes and the door was already ajar periodmark nextline nextline well commamark there you are commamark Harry said quietly commamark snape's already got past fluffy periodmark nextline nextline seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them periodmark underneath the cloak commamark Harry turned to the other two periodmark nextline nextline if you want to go back commamark i won't blame you commamark he said periodmark you can take the cloak commamark i won't need it now periodmark nextline nextline don't be stupid commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline we're coming commamark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline Harry pushed the door open periodmark nextline nextline as the door creaked commamark low commamark rumbling growls met their ears periodmark all three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction commamark even though it couldn't see them periodmark nextline nextline what's that at its feet questionmark Hermione whispered periodmark nextline nextline looks like a harp commamark said ron periodmark snape must have left it there periodmark nextline nextline it must wake up the moment you stop playing commamark said Harry periodmark well commamark here goes periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline he put hagrid's flute to his lips and blew periodmark it wasn't really a tune commamark but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop periodmark Harry hardly drew breath periodmark slowly commamark the dog's growls ceased 2dashes it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees commamark then it slumped to the ground commamark fast asleep periodmark nextline nextline keep playing commamark ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor periodmark they could feel the dog's hot commamark smelly breath as they approached the giant heads periodmark i think we'll be able to pull the door open commamark said ron commamark peering over the dog's back periodmark want to go first commamark Hermione questionmark nextline nextline no commamark i don't exclamationmark nextline nextline all right periodmark ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs periodmark he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor commamark which swung up and open periodmark nextline nextline what can you see questionmark Hermione said anxiously periodmark nextline nextline nothing 2dashes just black 2dashes there's no way of climbing down commamark we'll just have to drop periodmark nextline nextline Harry commamark who was still playing the flute commamark waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself periodmark nextline nextline you want to go first questionmark are you sure questionmark said ron periodmark i don't know how deep this thing goes periodmark give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep periodmark nextline nextline Harry handed the flute over periodmark in the few seconds' silence commamark the dog growled and twitched commamark but the moment Hermione began to play commamark it fell back into its deep sleep periodmark nextline nextline Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor periodmark there was no sign of the bottom periodmark nextline nextline he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips periodmark then he looked up at ron and said commamark if anything happens to me commamark don't follow periodmark go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to dumbledore commamark right questionmark nextline nextline right commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline see you in a minute commamark i hope periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline and Harry let go periodmark cold commamark damp air rushed past him as he fell down commamark down commamark down and 2dashes flump periodmark with a funny commamark muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft periodmark he sat up and felt around commamark his eyes not used to the gloom periodmark it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant periodmark nextline nextline it's okay exclamationmark he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp commamark which was the open trapdoor commamark it's a soft landing commamark you can jump exclamationmark nextline nextline ron followed right away periodmark he landed commamark sprawled next to Harry periodmark nextline nextline what's this stuff questionmark were his first words periodmark nextline nextline dunno commamark some sort of plant thing periodmark i suppose it's here to break the fall periodmark nextline nextline come on commamark Hermione exclamationmark nextline nextline the distant music stopped periodmark there was a loud bark from the dog commamark but Hermione had already jumped periodmark she landed on harry's other side periodmark nextline nextline we must be miles under the school commamark she said periodmark nextline nextline lucky this plant thing's here commamark really commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline lucky exclamationmark shrieked Hermione periodmark look at you both exclamationmark nextline nextline she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall periodmark she had to struggle because the moment she had landed commamark the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles periodmark as for Harry and ron commamark their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing periodmark nextline nextline Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her periodmark now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them commamark but the more they strained against it commamark the tighter and faster the plant wound around them periodmark nextline nextline stop moving exclamationmark Hermione ordered them periodmark i know what this is 2dashes it's devil's snare exclamationmark nextline nextline oh commamark i'm so glad we know what it's called commamark that's a great help commamark snarled ron commamark leaning back commamark trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck periodmark shut up commamark i'm trying to remember how to kill it exclamationmark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline well commamark hurry up commamark i can't breathe exclamationmark Harry gasped commamark wrestling with it as it curled around his chest periodmark nextline nextline devil's snare commamark devil's snare periodmark periodmark periodmark what did Professor Sprout say questionmark 2dashes it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire exclamationmark Harry choked periodmark nextline nextline yes 2dashes of course 2dashes but there's no wood exclamationmark Hermione cried commamark wringing her hands periodmark nextline nextline have you gone mad questionmark ron bellowed periodmark are you a witch or not questionmark nextline nextline oh commamark right exclamationmark said Hermione commamark and she whipped out her wand commamark waved it commamark muttered something commamark and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant periodmark in a matter of seconds commamark the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth periodmark nextline nextline wriggling and flailing commamark it unraveled itself from their bodies commamark and they were able to pull free periodmark nextline nextline lucky you pay attention in herbology commamark Hermione commamark said Harry as he joined her by the wall commamark wiping sweat off his face periodmark nextline nextline yeah commamark said ron commamark and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis 2dashes 'there's no wood commamark' honestly periodmark nextline nextline this way commamark said Harry commamark pointing down a stone passageway commamark which was the only way forward periodmark nextline nextline all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls periodmark the passageway sloped downward commamark and Harry was reminded of gringotts periodmark with an unpleasant jolt of the heart commamark he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank periodmark if they met a dragon commamark a fully-grown dragon 2dashes norbert had been bad enough periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline can you hear something questionmark ron whispered periodmark nextline nextline Harry listened periodmark a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead periodmark nextline nextline do you think it's a ghost questionmark nextline nextline i don't know periodmark periodmark periodmark sounds like wings to me periodmark nextline nextline there's light ahead 2dashes i can see something moving periodmark nextline nextline they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber commamark its ceiling arching high above them periodmark it was full of small commamark jewel-bright birds commamark fluttering and tumbling all around the room periodmark on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door periodmark nextline nextline do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room questionmark said ron periodmark nextline nextline probably commamark said Harry periodmark they don't look very vicious commamark but i suppose if they all swooped down at once periodmark periodmark periodmark well commamark there's no other choice periodmark periodmark periodmark i'll run periodmark nextline nextline he took a deep breath commamark covered his face with his arms commamark and sprinted across the room periodmark he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second commamark but nothing happened periodmark he reached the door untouched periodmark he pulled the handle commamark but it was locked periodmark nextline nextline the other two followed him periodmark they tugged and heaved at the door commamark but it wouldn't budge commamark not even when Hermione tried her alohomora charm periodmark nextline nextline now what questionmark said ron periodmark nextline nextline these birds periodmark periodmark periodmark they can't be here just for decoration commamark said Hermione periodmark nextline nextline they watched the birds soaring overhead commamark glittering 2dashes glittering questionmark they're not birds exclamationmark Harry said suddenly periodmark they're keys exclamationmark winged keys 2dashes look carefully periodmark so that must mean periodmark periodmark periodmark he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark yes 2dashes look exclamationmark broomsticks exclamationmark we've got to catch the key to the door exclamationmark nextline nextline but there are hundreds of them exclamationmark nextline nextline ron examined the lock on the door periodmark nextline nextline we're looking for a big commamark old-fashioned one 2dashes probably silver commamark like the handle periodmark nextline nextline they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air commamark soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys periodmark they grabbed and snatched commamark but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one periodmark nextline nextline not for nothing commamark though commamark was Harry the youngest seeker in a century periodmark he had a knack for spotting things other people didn't periodmark after a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers commamark he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing commamark as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole periodmark nextline nextline that one exclamationmark he called to the others periodmark that big one 2dashes there 2dashes no commamark there 2dashes with bright blue wings 2dashes the feathers are all crumpled on one side periodmark nextline nextline ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing commamark crashed into the ceiling commamark and nearly fell off his broom periodmark nextline nextline we've got to close in on it exclamationmark Harry called commamark not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing periodmark ron commamark you come at it from above 2dashes Hermione commamark stay below and stop it from going down and i'll try and catch it periodmark right commamark now exclamationmark nextline nextline ron dived commamark Hermione rocketed upward commamark the key dodged them both commamark and Harry streaked after it semicolonmark it sped toward the wall commamark Harry leaned forward and with a nasty commamark crunching noise commamark pinned it against the stone with one hand periodmark ron and hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber periodmark nextline nextline they landed quickly commamark and Harry ran to the door commamark the key struggling in his hand periodmark he rammed it into the lock and turned 2dashes it worked periodmark the moment the lock had clicked open commamark the key took flight again commamark looking very battered now that it had been caught twice periodmark nextline nextline ready questionmark Harry asked the other two commamark his hand on the door handle periodmark they nodded periodmark he pulled the door open periodmark nextline nextline the next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all periodmark but as they stepped into it commamark light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight periodmark nextline nextline they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard commamark behind the black chessmen commamark which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone periodmark facing them commamark way across the chamber commamark were the white pieces periodmark Harry commamark ron and Hermione shivered slightly 2dashes the towering white chessmen had no faces periodmark nextline nextline now what do we do questionmark Harry whispered periodmark nextline nextline it's obvious commamark isn't it questionmark said ron periodmark we've got to play our way across the room periodmark nextline nextline behind the white pieces they could see another door periodmark nextline nextline how questionmark said Hermione nervously periodmark nextline nextline i think commamark said ron commamark we're going to have to be chessmen periodmark nextline nextline he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse periodmark at once commamark the stone sprang to life periodmark the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron periodmark nextline nextline do we 2dashes er 2dashes have to join you to get across questionmark the black knight nodded periodmark ron turned to the other two periodmark nextline nextline this needs thinking about he said periodmark i suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline Harry and Hermione stayed quiet commamark watching ron think periodmark finally he said commamark now commamark don't be offended or anything commamark but neither of you are that good at chess 2dashes nextline nextline we're not offended commamark said Harry quickly periodmark just tell us what to do periodmark nextline nextline well commamark Harry commamark you take the place of that bishop commamark and Hermione commamark you 90 next to him instead of that castle periodmark nextline nextline what about you questionmark nextline nextline i'm going to be a knight commamark said ron periodmark nextline nextline the chessmen seemed to have been listening commamark because at these words a knight commamark a bishop commamark and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board commamark leaving three empty squares that Harry commamark ron commamark and Hermione took periodmark nextline nextline white always plays first in chess commamark said ron commamark peering across the board periodmark nextline nextline yes periodmark periodmark periodmark look periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline a white pawn had moved forward two squares periodmark nextline nextline ron started to direct the black pieces periodmark they moved silently wherever he sent them periodmark harry's knees were trembling periodmark what if they lost questionmark Harry 2dashes move diagonally four squares to the right periodmark nextline nextline their first real shock came when their other knight was taken periodmark the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board commamark where he lay quite still commamark facedown periodmark nextline nextline had to let that happen commamark said ron commamark looking shaken periodmark leaves you free to take that bishop commamark Hermione commamark go on periodmark nextline nextline every time one of their men was lost commamark the white pieces showed no mercy periodmark nextline nextline soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall periodmark nextline nextline twice commamark ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger periodmark he himself darted around the board commamark taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones periodmark nextline nextline we're nearly there commamark he muttered suddenly periodmark let me think let me think periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline the white queen turned her blank face toward him periodmark nextline nextline yes periodmark periodmark periodmark said ron softly commamark it's the only way periodmark periodmark periodmark i've got to be taken periodmark nextline nextline nof Harry and Hermione shouted periodmark nextline nextline that's chess exclamationmark snapped ron periodmark you've got to make some sacrifices exclamationmark i take one step forward and she'll take me 2dashes that leaves you free to checkmate the king commamark Harry exclamationmark nextline nextline but 2dashes nextline nextline do you want to stop snape or not questionmark nextline nextline ron 2dashes nextline nextline look commamark if you don't hurry up commamark he'll already have the stone exclamationmark nextline nextline there was no alternative periodmark nextline nextline ready questionmark ron called commamark his face pale but determined periodmark here i go - now commamark don't hang around once you've won periodmark nextline nextline he stepped forward commamark and the white queen pounced periodmark she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm commamark and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged ron to one side periodmark he looked as if he'd been knocked out periodmark nextline nextline shaking commamark Harry moved three spaces to the left periodmark nextline nextline the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry's feet periodmark they had won periodmark the chessmen parted and bowed commamark leaving the door ahead clear periodmark with one last desperate look back at ron commamark Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway periodmark nextline nextline what if he's 2dashes questionmark nextline nextline he'll be all right commamark said Harry commamark trying to convince himself periodmark what do you reckon's next questionmark nextline nextline we've had sprout's commamark that was the devil's snare semicolonmark flitwick must've put charms on the keys semicolonmark McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive semicolonmark that leaves quirrell's spell commamark and snape's periodmark nextline nextline they had reached another door periodmark nextline nextline all right questionmark Harry whispered periodmark nextline nextline go on periodmark nextline nextline Harry pushed it open periodmark nextline nextline a disgusting smell filled their nostrils commamark making both of them pull their robes up over their noses periodmark eyes watering commamark they saw commamark flat on the floor in front of them commamark a troll even larger than the one they had tackled commamark out cold with a bloody lump on its head periodmark nextline nextline i'm glad we didn't have to fight that one commamark Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs periodmark come on commamark i can't breathe periodmark nextline nextline he pulled open the next door commamark both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here commamark just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line periodmark nextline nextline snape's commamark said Harry periodmark what do we have to do questionmark nextline nextline they stepped over the threshold commamark and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway periodmark it wasn't ordinary fire either semicolonmark it was purple periodmark at the same instant commamark black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward periodmark nextline nextline they were trapped periodmark nextline nextline look exclamationmark Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles periodmark Harry looked over her shoulder to read it colonmark danger lies before you commamark while safety lies behind commamark two of us will help you commamark which ever you would find commamark one among us seven will let you move ahead commamark another will transport the drinker back instead commamark two among our number hold only nettle wine commamark three of us are killers commamark waiting bidden in line periodmark nextline nextline choose commamark unless you wish to stay here forevermore commamark to help you in your choice commamark we give you these clues four colonmark first commamark however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine's left side semicolonmark second commamark different are those who stand at either end commamark but if you would move onward commamark neither is your friend semicolonmark third commamark as you see clearly commamark all are different size commamark neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides semicolonmark fourth commamark the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them commamark though different at first sight periodmark nextline nextline Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry commamark amazed commamark saw that she was smiling commamark the very last thing he felt like doing periodmark nextline nextline brilliant commamark said Hermione periodmark this isn't magic 2dashes it's logic 2dashes a puzzle periodmark nextline nextline a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic commamark they'd be stuck in here forever periodmark nextline nextline but so will we commamark won't we questionmark of course not commamark said Hermione periodmark everything we need is here on this paper periodmark seven bottles colonmark three are poison semicolonmark two are wine semicolonmark one will get us safely through the black fire commamark and one will get us back through the purple periodmark nextline nextline but how do we know which to drink questionmark nextline nextline give me a minute periodmark nextline nextline Hermione read the paper several times periodmark then she walked up and down the line of bottles commamark muttering to herself and pointing at them periodmark at last commamark she clapped her hands periodmark nextline nextline got it commamark she said periodmark the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire 2dashes toward the stone periodmark nextline nextline Harry looked at the tiny bottle periodmark nextline nextline there's only enough there for one of us commamark he said periodmark that's hardly one swallow periodmark nextline nextline they looked at each other periodmark nextline nextline which one will get you back through the purple flames questionmark nextline nextline Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line periodmark nextline nextline you drink that commamark said Harry periodmark no commamark listen commamark get back and get ron periodmark grab brooms from the flying- key room commamark they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy 2dashes go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to dumbledore commamark we need him periodmark i might be able to hold snape off for a while commamark but i'm no match for him commamark really periodmark nextline nextline but Harry 2dashes what if you-know-who's with him questionmark nextline nextline well 2dashes i was lucky once commamark wasn't i questionmark said Harry commamark pointing at his scar periodmark nextline nextline i might get lucky again periodmark nextline nextline hermione's lip trembled commamark and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him periodmark nextline nextline Hermione exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry 2dashes you're a great wizard commamark you know periodmark nextline nextline i'm not as good as you commamark said Harry commamark very embarrassed commamark as she let go of him periodmark nextline nextline me exclamationmark said Hermione periodmark books exclamationmark and cleverness exclamationmark there are more important things 2dashes friendship and bravery and 2dashes oh Harry 2dashes be careful exclamationmark nextline nextline you drink first commamark said Harry periodmark you are sure which is which commamark aren't you questionmark nextline nextline positive commamark said Hermione periodmark she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end commamark and shuddered periodmark nextline nextline it's not poison questionmark said Harry anxiously periodmark nextline nextline no 2dashes but it's like ice periodmark nextline nextline quick commamark go commamark before it wears off periodmark nextline nextline good luck 2dashes take care periodmark nextline nextline go exclamationmark nextline nextline Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire periodmark nextline nextline Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle periodmark he turned to face the black flames periodmark nextline nextline here i come commamark he said commamark and he drained the little bottle in one gulp periodmark nextline nextline it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body periodmark he put the bottle down and walked forward semicolonmark he braced himself commamark saw the black flames licking his body commamark but couldn't feel them 2dashes for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire 2dashes then he was on the other side commamark in the last chamber periodmark nextline nextline there was already someone there 2dashes but it wasn't snape periodmark it wasn't even Voldemort periodmark nextline nextline chapter seventeen nextline nextline the man with two faces it was quirrell periodmark nextline nextline you exclamationmark gasped Harry periodmark nextline nextline quirrell smiled periodmark his face wasn't twitching at all periodmark nextline nextline me commamark he said calmly periodmark i wondered whether i'd be meeting you here commamark Potter periodmark nextline nextline but i thought 2dashes snape 2dashes nextline nextline severus questionmark quirrell laughed commamark and it wasn't his usual quivering treble commamark either commamark but cold and sharp periodmark yes commamark severus does seem the type commamark doesn't he questionmark so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat periodmark next to him commamark who would suspect p-p-poor commamark st-stuttering p-professor quirrell questionmark nextline nextline Harry couldn't take it in periodmark this couldn't be true commamark it couldn't periodmark nextline nextline but snape tried to kill me exclamationmark nextline nextline no commamark no commamark no periodmark i tried to kill you periodmark your friend miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match periodmark she broke my eye contact with you periodmark another few seconds and i'd have got you off that broom periodmark i'd have managed it before then if snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse commamark trying to save you periodmark nextline nextline snape was trying to save me questionmark nextline nextline of course commamark said quirrell coolly periodmark \\why do you think he wanted to referee your next match questionmark he was trying to make sure i didn't do it again periodmark funny commamark really periodmark periodmark periodmark he needn't have bothered periodmark i couldn't do anything with dumbledore watching periodmark all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning commamark he did make himself unpopular periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline and what a waste of time commamark when after all that commamark i'm going to kill you tonight periodmark nextline nextline quirrell snapped his fingers periodmark ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry periodmark nextline nextline you're too nosy to live commamark Potter periodmark scurrying around the school on halloween like that commamark for all i knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone periodmark nextline nextline you let the troll in questionmark nextline nextline certainly periodmark i have a special gift with trolls 2dashes you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there questionmark unfortunately commamark while everyone else was running around looking for it commamark snape commamark who already suspected me commamark went straight to the third floor to head me off 2dashes and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death commamark that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite snape's leg off properly periodmark nextline nextline now commamark wait quietly commamark Potter periodmark i need to examine this interesting mirror periodmark nextline nextline it was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind quirrell periodmark nextline nextline it was the mirror of erised periodmark nextline nextline this mirror is the key to finding the stone commamark quirrell murmured commamark tapping his way around the frame periodmark trust dumbledore to come up with something like this periodmark periodmark periodmark but he's in london periodmark periodmark periodmark i'll be far away by the time he gets back periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline all Harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror periodmark nextline nextline i saw you and snape in the forest 2dashes he blurted out periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark said quirrell idly commamark walking around the mirror to look at the back periodmark he was on to me by that time commamark trying to find out how far i'd got periodmark nextline nextline he suspected me all along periodmark tried to frighten me - as though he could commamark when i had lord Voldemort on my side periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it periodmark nextline nextline i see the stone periodmark periodmark periodmark i'm presenting it to my master periodmark periodmark periodmark but where is it questionmark nextline nextline Harry struggled against the ropes binding him commamark but they didn't give periodmark he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror periodmark nextline nextline but snape always seemed to hate me so much periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark he does commamark said quirrell casually commamark heavens commamark yes periodmark he was at hogwarts with your father commamark didn't you know questionmark they

nextline nextline quirrell cursed under his breath periodmark nextline nextline i don't understand periodmark periodmark periodmark is the stone inside the mirror questionmark should i break it questionmark nextline nextline harry's mind was racing periodmark nextline nextline what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment commamark he thought commamark is to find the stone before quirrell does periodmark so if i look in the mirror commamark i should see myseff finding it 2dashes which means i'll see where it's hidden exclamationmark but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i'm up to questionmark he tried to edge to the left commamark to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing commamark but the ropes around his ankles were too tight colonmark he tripped and fell over periodmark quirrell ignored him periodmark he was still talking to himself periodmark what does this mirror do questionmark how does it work questionmark help me commamark master exclamationmark nextline nextline and to harry's horror commamark a voice answered commamark and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy periodmark periodmark periodmark use

what you see periodmark nextline nextline Harry walked toward him periodmark nextline nextline i must lie commamark he thought desperately periodmark i must look and lie about what i see commamark that's all periodmark nextline nextline quirrell moved close behind him periodmark Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell's turban periodmark he closed his eyes commamark stepped in front of the mirror commamark and opened them again periodmark nextline nextline he saw his reflection commamark pale and scared-looking at first periodmark but a moment later commamark the reflection smiled at him periodmark it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone periodmark it winked and put the stone back in its pocket 2dashes and as it did so commamark Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket periodmark somehow 2dashes incredibly 2dashes he'd gotten the stone periodmark nextline nextline well questionmark said quirrell impatiently periodmark what do you see questionmark nextline nextline Harry screwed up his courage periodmark nextline nextline i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore commamark he invented periodmark i 2dashes i've won the house cup for gryffindor periodmark nextline nextline quirrell cursed again periodmark nextline nextline get out of the way commamark he said periodmark as Harry moved aside commamark he felt the

periodmark face-to-face periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline master commamark you are not strong enough exclamationmark nextline nextline i have strength enough periodmark periodmark periodmark for this periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline Harry felt as if devil's snare was rooting him to the spot periodmark he couldn't move a muscle periodmark petrified commamark he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban periodmark what was going on questionmark the turban fell away periodmark quirrell's head looked strangely small without it periodmark then he turned slowly on the spot periodmark nextline nextline Harry would have screamed commamark but he couldn't make a sound periodmark where there should have been a back to quirrell's head commamark there was a face commamark the most terrible face Harry had ever seen periodmark it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils commamark like a snake periodmark nextline nextline Harry Potter periodmark periodmark periodmark it whispered periodmark nextline nextline Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move periodmark nextline nextline see what i have become questionmark the face said periodmark mere shadow and vapor periodmark periodmark periodmark i have form only when i can share another's body periodmark periodmark periodmark but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark unicorn blood has strengthened me commamark these past weeks periodmark periodmark periodmark you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest periodmark periodmark periodmark and once i have the elixir of life commamark i will be able to create a body of my own periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark now periodmark periodmark periodmark why don't you give me that stone in your pocket questionmark nextline nextline so he knew periodmark the feeling suddenly surged back into harry's legs periodmark he stumbled backward periodmark nextline nextline don't be a fool commamark snarled the face periodmark better save your own life and join me periodmark periodmark periodmark or you'll meet the same end as your parents periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark they died begging me for mercy periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline liar exclamationmark Harry shouted suddenly periodmark nextline nextline quirrell was walking backward at him commamark so that Voldemort could still see him periodmark the evil face was now smiling periodmark nextline nextline how touching periodmark periodmark periodmark it hissed periodmark i always value bravery periodmark periodmark periodmark yes commamark boy commamark your parents were brave periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark i killed your father first semicolonmark and he put up a courageous fight periodmark periodmark periodmark but your mother needn't have died

nextline never exclamationmark nextline nextline Harry sprang toward the flame door commamark but Voldemort screamed seize him exclamationmark nextline nextline and the next second commamark Harry felt quirrell's hand close on his wrist periodmark at once commamark a needle-sharp pain seared across harry's scar semicolonmark his head felt as though it was about to split in two semicolonmark he yelled commamark struggling with all his might commamark and to his surprise commamark quirrell let go of him periodmark the pain in his head lessened 2dashes he looked around wildly to see where

exclamationmark shrieked Voldemort again commamark and quirrell lunged commamark knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him commamark both hands around harry's neck 2dashes harry's scar

nextline nextline and quirrell commamark though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees commamark let go of his neck and stared commamark bewildered commamark at his own palms 2dashes Harry could see they looked burned commamark raw commamark red commamark and shiny periodmark nextline nextline then kill him commamark fool commamark and be done exclamationmark screeched Voldemort periodmark nextline nextline quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse commamark but Harry commamark by instinct commamark reached up and grabbed quirrell's face 2dashes aaaargh exclamationmark nextline nextline quirrell rolled off him commamark his face blistering commamark too commamark and then Harry knew colonmark quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin commamark not without suffering terrible pain 2dashes his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell commamark keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse periodmark nextline nextline Harry jumped to his feet commamark caught quirrell by the arm commamark and hung on as tight as he could periodmark quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off 2dashes the pain in harry's head was building 2dashes he couldn't see 2dashes he could only hear quirrell's terrible shrieks and voldemort's yells of commamark kill him exclamationmark kill him exclamationmark and other voices commamark maybe in harry's own head commamark crying commamark Harry exclamationmark Harry exclamationmark nextline nextline he felt quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp commamark knew all was lost commamark and fell into blackness commamark down periodmark periodmark periodmark down periodmark periodmark periodmark down periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline something gold was glinting just above him periodmark the snitch exclamationmark he tried to catch it commamark but his arms were too heavy periodmark nextline nextline he blinked periodmark it wasn't the snitch at all periodmark it was a pair of glasses periodmark how strange periodmark nextline nextline he blinked again periodmark the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him periodmark nextline nextline good afternoon commamark Harry commamark said dumbledore periodmark Harry stared at him periodmark then he remembered colonmark sir exclamationmark the stone exclamationmark it was quirrell exclamationmark he's got the stone exclamationmark sir commamark quick 2dashes nextline nextline calm yourself commamark dear boy commamark you are a little behind the times commamark said dumbledore periodmark quirrell does not have the stone periodmark nextline nextline then who does questionmark sir commamark i 2dashes nextline nextline Harry commamark please relax commamark or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out periodmark nextline nextline Harry swallowed and looked around him periodmark he realized he must be in the hospital wing periodmark he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets commamark and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop periodmark nextline nextline tokens from your friends and admirers commamark said dumbledore commamark beaming periodmark what happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor quirrell is a complete secret commamark so commamark naturally commamark the whole school knows periodmark i believe your friends misters Fred and george Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat periodmark no doubt they thought it would amuse you periodmark madam pomfrey commamark however commamark felt it might not be very hygienic commamark and confiscated it periodmark nextline nextline how long have i been in here questionmark nextline nextline three days periodmark mr periodmark Ronald Weasley and miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round commamark they have been extremely worried periodmark nextline nextline but sit commamark the stone i see you are not to be distracted periodmark very well commamark the stone periodmark Professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you periodmark i arrived in time to prevent that commamark although you were doing very well on your own commamark i must say periodmark nextline nextline you got there questionmark you got hermione's owl questionmark nextline nextline we must have crossed in midair periodmark no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left periodmark i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you periodmark nextline nextline it was you periodmark nextline nextline i feared i might be too late periodmark nextline nextline you nearly were commamark i couldn't have kept him off the stone much longer 2dashes nextline nextline not the stone commamark boy commamark you 2dashes the effort involved nearly killed you periodmark for one terrible moment there commamark i was afraid it had periodmark as for the stone commamark it has been destroyed periodmark nextline nextline destroyed questionmark said Harry blankly periodmark but your friend 2dashes nicolas flamel 2dashes nextline nextline oh commamark you know about nicolas questionmark said dumbledore commamark sounding quite delighted periodmark nextline nextline you did do the thing properly commamark didn't you questionmark well commamark nicolas and i have had a little chat commamark and agreed it's all for the best periodmark nextline nextline but that means he and his wife will die commamark won't they questionmark nextline nextline they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then commamark yes commamark they will die periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry's face periodmark nextline nextline to one as young as you commamark i'm sure it seems incredible commamark but to nicolas and perenelle commamark it really is like going to bed after a very commamark very long day periodmark after all commamark to the well-organized mind commamark death is but the next great adventure periodmark you know commamark the stone was really not such a wonderful thing periodmark as much money and life as you could want exclamationmark the two things most human beings would choose above all 2dashes the trouble is commamark humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them periodmark Harry lay there commamark lost for words periodmark dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling periodmark nextline nextline sir questionmark said Harry periodmark i've been thinking periodmark periodmark periodmark sir 2dashes even if the stone's gone commamark vol- commamark i mean commamark you-know- who 2dashes nextline nextline call him Voldemort commamark Harry periodmark always use the proper name for things periodmark fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself periodmark nextline nextline yes commamark sir periodmark well commamark voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back commamark isn't he questionmark i mean commamark he hasn't gone commamark has he questionmark nextline nextline no commamark Harry commamark he has not periodmark he is still out there somewhere commamark perhaps looking for another body to share periodmark periodmark periodmark not being truly alive commamark he cannot be killed periodmark nextline nextline he left quirrell to die semicolonmark he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies periodmark nevertheless commamark Harry commamark while you may only have delayed his return to power commamark it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time 2dashes and if he is delayed again commamark and again commamark why commamark he may never return to power periodmark nextline nextline Harry nodded commamark but stopped quickly commamark because it made his head hurt periodmark then he said commamark sir commamark there are some other things i'd like to know commamark if you can tell me periodmark periodmark periodmark things i want to know the truth about periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline the truth periodmark dumbledore sighed periodmark it is a beautiful and terrible thing commamark and should therefore be treated with great caution periodmark however commamark i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to commamark in which case i beg you'll forgive me periodmark i shall not commamark of course commamark lie periodmark nextline nextline well periodmark periodmark periodmark Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me periodmark but why would he want to kill me in the first place questionmark nextline nextline dumbledore sighed very deeply this time periodmark nextline nextline alas commamark the first thing you ask me commamark i cannot tell you periodmark not today periodmark not now periodmark you will know commamark one day periodmark periodmark periodmark put it from your mind for now commamark Harry periodmark nextline nextline when you are older periodmark periodmark periodmark i know you hate to hear this periodmark periodmark periodmark when you are ready commamark you will know periodmark nextline nextline and Harry knew it would be no good to argue periodmark nextline nextline but why couldn't quirrell touch me questionmark nextline nextline your mother died to save you periodmark if there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand commamark it is love periodmark he didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark periodmark not a scar commamark no visible sign periodmark periodmark periodmark to have been loved so deeply commamark even though the person who loved us is gone commamark will give us some protection forever periodmark it is in your very skin periodmark quirrell commamark full of hatred commamark greed commamark and ambition commamark sharing his soul with Voldemort commamark could not touch you for this reason periodmark it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good periodmark nextline nextline dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill commamark which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet periodmark when he had found his voice again commamark Harry said commamark and the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me questionmark nextline nextline ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession commamark and i thought you might like it periodmark dumbledore's eyes twinkled periodmark useful things periodmark periodmark periodmark your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here periodmark nextline nextline and there's something else periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline fire away periodmark nextline nextline quirrell said snape 2dashes nextline nextline Professor snape commamark Harry periodmark yes commamark him 2dashes quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father periodmark is that true questionmark nextline nextline well commamark they did rather detest each other periodmark not unlike yourself and mr periodmark Malfoy periodmark and then commamark your father did something snape could never forgive periodmark nextline nextline what questionmark nextline nextline he saved his life periodmark nextline nextline what questionmark nextline nextline yes periodmark periodmark periodmark said dumbledore dreamily periodmark funny commamark the way people's minds work commamark isn't it questionmark Professor snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even periodmark then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound commamark so he stopped periodmark nextline nextline and sir commamark there's one more thing periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline just the one questionmark nextline nextline how did i get the stone out of the mirror questionmark nextline nextline ah commamark now commamark i'm glad you asked me that periodmark it was one of my more brilliant ideas commamark and between you and me commamark that's saying something periodmark you see commamark only one who wanted to find the stone 2dashes find it commamark but not use it 2dashes would be able to get it commamark otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life periodmark my brain surprises even me sometimes periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark now commamark enough questions periodmark i suggest you make a start on these sweets periodmark ah exclamationmark bettie bott's every flavor beans exclamationmark i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one commamark and since then i'm afraid i've rather lost my liking for them 2dashes but i think i'll be safe with a nice toffee commamark don't you questionmark nextline nextline he smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth periodmark then he choked and said commamark alas exclamationmark ear wax exclamationmark nextline nextline madam pomfrey commamark the nurse commamark was a nice woman commamark but very strict periodmark nextline nextline just five minutes commamark Harry pleaded periodmark nextline nextline absolutely not periodmark nextline nextline you let Professor dumbledore in periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline well commamark of course commamark that was the headmaster commamark quite different periodmark you need rest periodmark nextline nextline i am resting commamark look commamark lying down and everything periodmark oh commamark go on commamark madam pomfrey periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark very well commamark she said periodmark but five minutes only periodmark nextline nextline and she let ron and Hermione in periodmark nextline nextline Harry exclamationmark nextline nextline Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again commamark but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark Harry commamark we were sure you were going to 2dashes dumbledore was so worried 2dashes nextline nextline the whole school's talking about it commamark said ron periodmark what really happened questionmark nextline nextline it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors periodmark Harry told them everything colonmark quirrell semicolonmark the mirror semicolonmark the stone semicolonmark and Voldemort periodmark ron and Hermione were a very good audience semicolonmark they gasped in all the right places commamark and when Harry told them what was under quirrell's turban commamark Hermione screamed out loud periodmark nextline nextline so the stone's gone questionmark said ron finally periodmark flamel's just going to die questionmark nextline nextline that's what i said commamark but dumbledore thinks that 2dashes what was it questionmark 2dashes 'to the well-organized mind commamark death is but the next great adventure periodmark nextline nextline i always said he was off his rocker commamark said ron commamark looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was periodmark nextline nextline so what happened to you two questionmark said Harry periodmark nextline nextline well commamark i got back all right commamark said Hermione periodmark i brought ron round 2dashes that took a while 2dashes and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall 2dashes he already knew 2dashes he just said commamark 'harry's gone after him commamark hasn't he questionmark' and hurtled off to the third floor periodmark nextline nextline d'you think he meant you to do it questionmark said ron periodmark sending you your father's cloak and everything questionmark nextline nextline well commamark Hermione exploded commamark if he did 2dashes i mean to say that's terrible 2dashes you could have been killed periodmark nextline nextline no commamark it isn't commamark said Harry thoughtfully periodmark he's a funny man commamark dumbledore periodmark nextline nextline i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance periodmark i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here commamark you know periodmark i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try commamark and instead of stopping us commamark he just taught us enough to help periodmark i don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked periodmark it's almost like he thought i had the right to face Voldemort if i could periodmark periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline yeah commamark dumbledore's off his rocker commamark all right commamark said ron proudly periodmark nextline nextline listen commamark you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow periodmark the points are all in and slytherin won commamark of course 2dashes you missed the last quidditch match commamark we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you 2dashes but the food'll be good periodmark nextline nextline at that moment commamark madam pomfrey bustled over periodmark nextline nextline you've had nearly fifteen minutes commamark now out she said firmly periodmark nextline nextline after a good night's sleep commamark Harry felt nearly back to normal periodmark nextline nextline i want to go to the feast commamark he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes periodmark i can commamark can't i questionmark nextline nextline Professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go commamark she said stiffily commamark as though in her opinion Professor dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be periodmark and you have another visitor periodmark nextline nextline oh commamark good commamark said Harry periodmark who is it questionmark nextline nextline Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke periodmark as usual when he was indoors commamark Hagrid looked too big to be allowed periodmark he sat down next to Harry commamark took one look at him commamark and burst into tears periodmark nextline nextline it's 2dashes all 2dashes my 2dashes ruddy 2dashes fault exclamationmark he sobbed commamark his face in his hands periodmark nextline nextline i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy exclamationmark i told him exclamationmark it was the only thing he didn't know commamark an' i

exclamationmark nextline nextline Hagrid exclamationmark said Harry commamark shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse commamark great tears leaking down into his beard periodmark Hagrid commamark he'd have found out somehow commamark this is Voldemort we're talking about commamark he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him periodmark nextline nextline yeh could've died

dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it periodmark 'course commamark he shoulda sacked me instead 2dashes anyway commamark got yeh this periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline it seemed to be a handsome commamark leather-covered book periodmark Harry opened it curiously periodmark it was full of wizard photographs periodmark smiling and waving at him from every page were

periodmark periodmark d'yeh like it questionmark nextline nextline Harry couldn't speak commamark but Hagrid understood periodmark nextline nextline Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night periodmark he had been held up by madam pomfrey's fussing about commamark insisting on giving him one last checkup commamark so the great hall was already full periodmark it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row periodmark a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table periodmark nextline nextline when Harry walked in there was a sudden hush commamark and then everybody started talking loudly at once periodmark he slipped into a seat between ron and Hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him periodmark nextline nextline fortunately commamark dumbledore arrived moments later periodmark the babble died away periodmark nextline nextline another year gone exclamationmark dumbledore said cheerfully periodmark and i must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle

nextline nextline yes commamark yes commamark well done commamark slytherin commamark said dumbledore periodmark however commamark recent events must be taken into account periodmark nextline nextline the room went very still periodmark the slytherins' smiles faded a little periodmark nextline nextline ahem commamark said dumbledore periodmark i have a few last-minute points to dish out periodmark nextline nextline let me see periodmark yes periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline first 2dashes to mr periodmark Ronald Weasley periodmark periodmark periodmark nextline nextline ron went

the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage commamark i award gryffindor house sixty points periodmark nextline nextline the din was deafening periodmark those who could add up

courage commamark said dumbledore commamark smiling periodmark it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies commamark but just as much to stand up to our friends periodmark i therefore award ten points to mr periodmark neville longbottom periodmark nextline nextline someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place commamark so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table periodmark Harry commamark ron commamark and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville commamark white with shock commamark disappeared under a pile of people hugging him periodmark he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before periodmark nextline nextline Harry commamark still cheering commamark nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy commamark who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the body-bind curse put on him periodmark nextline nextline which means commamark dumbledore called
